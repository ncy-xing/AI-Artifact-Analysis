Good morning and welcome back to the first Morning Mail for 2023. New research says video-sharing platforms like TikTok are seeing a growing number of content creators making videos about their self-described tics, Tourette syndrome and other self-diagnosed disorders. This has coincided with increasing numbers of youth who have presented to clinical providers or psychiatric services with functional tic-like behaviours. Experts say we urgently need to investigate this, and ask if what’s driving it is a lack of mental health treatment options. 
Elsewhere, in a worrying echo of the 6 January invasion of the US Capitol, hundreds of hardcore supporters of Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro have stormed the country’s congress, presidential palace and supreme court. The shooting of a Virginia school teacher by a six-year-old pupil was not accidental, police say; Naomi Osaka formally withdraws from the Australian Open; and England will ban many single-use plastic items.

 Prince Harry | The “absolutely catastrophic” implications of attacks on the royal family’s behaviour in the new memoir from the Duke of Sussex are being ignored, according to Catherine Mayer, the royal analyst and biographer of King Charles. 
 Plastic ban | Single-use items such as plastic cutlery, plates and trays will be banned in England in a bid to reduce pollution, the government has confirmed.
