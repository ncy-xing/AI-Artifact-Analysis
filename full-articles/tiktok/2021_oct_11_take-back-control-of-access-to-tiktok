It isn’t TikTok that’s letting kids see inappropriate posts, it’s their parents (Revealed: anti-vaccine TikTok videos being viewed by children as young as nine, 8 October). There are controls that can stop young people signing up; it’s up to their parents and guardians to use them. I suggest a “revert to defaults” on kids’ devices once a day, or as often as necessary. Then get TikTok to deal with the liars. Take back control, people!David ReedLondon • I fully agree that “good children’s books are not a luxury” (Editorial, 8 October). In common with many children’s authors, self-publishing had to be my route. Now, five books and 16,500 sales on, I&nbsp;regularly delight in such feedback as: “I had to read your book to my child five times last night!” Lacking&nbsp;celebrity, and&nbsp;doing&nbsp;all our own marketing, we self-publishers soldier on.Sue WilkinsMatlock, Derbyshire • Once again (for the fourth time this year, I think) your obituaries page records the life of someone who came to the UK as a child refugee and made a tremendous contribution to society (Other lives: Gerda Mayer, 29 September). We should feel ashamed at Britain’s cruel rejection of child refugees today.Ruth KnoxLiverpool  • Never mind fluttering eyes (Letters, 8 October). How could a ranking of cinema’s greatest duels omit Steven Spielberg’s heart-thumping 1971 film Duel?Linda MockettWinnersh, Berkshire • Is the travelling fair in Hull (Best photographs of the day, 10 October) Europe’s largest superspreader event?Marlene GodfreyBeverley, East Riding of Yorkshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
