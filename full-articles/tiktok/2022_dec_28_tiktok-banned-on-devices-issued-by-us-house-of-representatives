TikTok has been banned from any devices issued by the US House of Representatives as political pressure continues to build on the Chinese-owned social video app. The order to delete the app was issued by Catherine Szpindor the chief administrative officer (CAO) of the House whose office had warned in August that the app represented a high risk to users. According to a memo obtained by NBC News all lawmakers and staffers with House-issued mobile phones have been ordered to remove TikTok by Szpindor. House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices NBC quoted the memo as saying. If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device you will be contacted to remove it. The move was also reported by Reuters. In a statement the US house of representatives confirmed the ban saying we can confirm that the Committee on House Administration has authorized the CAO Office of Cybersecurity to initiate the removal of TikTok Social Media Service from all House-managed devices. In August the CAO issued a cyber advisory labelling TikTok a high-risk app due to its lack of transparency in how it protects customer data. It said TikTok which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance actively harvests content for identifiable data and stores some user data in China. TikTok says its data is not held in China but in the US and Singapore.

Last week Congress passed a $1.7tn spending bill which includes a provision banning TikTok from government devices. The ban will take effect once President Joe Biden signs the legislation into law. According to Reuters at least 19 US states have partially blocked the app from state-managed devices over security concerns. In a statement released after the Congress ban TikTok said the move was a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests.   Related TikTok admits using its app to spy on reporters in effort to track leaks    This month the US senator Marco Rubio a former Republican presidential contender unveiled a legislative proposal to ban TikTok from the US entirely. Rubio said it was time to ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good. Biden has revoked presidential orders targeting TikTok issued by his predecessor Donald Trump which included requiring TikTok to sell its US business. However the US Committee on Foreign Investment which scrutinises business deals with non-US companies is also conducting a security review of TikTok. According to a recent Reuters report TikTok is offering to operate more of its US business at arm's length and subject it to outside scrutiny. The office of the House's chief administrative officer and TikTok have been approached for comment.
