Today in a nutshell five golds for Great Britain TikTok star Anastasia Pagonis is one of many athletes to smash world records but there's concern as one member of a Paralympic support team has been admitted to hospital with Covid symptoms. Tomorrow's key moments there are more medal opportunities in the swimming and at the velodrome the wheelchair tennis tournament starts and so does the rowing.

Jaco van Gass won gold with his teammate Fin Graham picking up silver in the men's C3 individual pursuit.

Jody Cundy picked up a silver in the men's C4-5 time trial which was won by Spain's Alfonso Cabello Llamas. Cundy becomes the first British man to win medals at seven Games having started his Paralympic journey in Atlanta in 1996. Aileen McGlynn also took silver along with her pilot Helen Scott in the women's B time trial. Larissa Klaassen of the Netherlands won gold in that race with a new Paralympics record.

Kearney added S5 women's 100m freestyle gold to the silver she earned in the 200m event on Wednesday. The 24-year-old from Nottingham said I don't think I have words to describe that shock really. I didn't expect to be able to go that quick. I said yesterday my fitness wasn't where I wanted it because of the injury. Today I felt rubbish in the warm-up I felt terrible in the heats struggling to recover from yesterday and sore shoulder and I was not expecting to be able to swim that quick. That is just insane.

The 26-year-old from Clontarf overtook New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe with 25m to go and held on to touch first. After the race she told RTÉ When I dove in my goggles filled up with water but I think that was maybe a good thing because I couldn't see where the girls were around me. Just on the turn I saw Sophie a little bit but I just had a game plan in mind and I stuck to that.     Ellen Keane of Ireland in action with those water-filled goggles.

The Netherlands struck gold twice through Rogier Dorsman and Chantalle Zijderveld. There's been a serious development away from the sport though with organisers saying that a foreign participant at the Paralympics not an athlete it appears has been taken to hospital with non-severe symptoms of Covid. There have been two more positive cases among athletes. And there has been criticism of the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach's decision to return to Tokyo for the opening Paralympics ceremony. He was later spotted sightseeing around the famous Ginza shopping area an activity forbidden to athletes.

A late replacement for her usual partner Fatal Attraction afterwards Wells said she went in with no expectation or pressure because it was Don Cara's first international competition. He's so sensitive and such an anxious character. My hope for him is just that he becomes confident in himself and actually believes in himself. He deserves to be here and he trusted me in the arena which was just a huge thing. There was also a British gold medal for the wheelchair fencing world champion Piers Gilliver in the men's category A épée. The 26-year-old from Gloucestershire beat Russian Maxim Shaburov 15-11. Fellow British fencer Dimitri Coutya picked up bronze in the men's category B. I'm a little overwhelmed but very happy said Gilliver who exited the sabre contest on Wednesday at the last-16 stage. Maxim has been a huge rival of mine for years so I just focused on my own game plan and executed it as best I could.     Gold medalist Piers Gilliver celebrates on the podium.

There was a mixed day in the wheelchair basketball. The ParalympicsGB men convincingly beat Algeria 70-43. However the women succumbed to a second defeat in two days losing 54-48 to hosts Japan. It doesn't make it impossible for them to make the quarter-finals yet but their remaining matches against Germany and Australia look like must-wins.

Newsom had been aiming for a medal at a third successive Paralympic Games but fell well short of her personal best in a tense final. Lingling gave a display of dominance however breaking the Paralympic record with her very first lift.

Japan's Takayuki Suzuki delivered a first gold medal of the Tokyo Games for the hosts. He won the men's 100m freestyle S4 setting a new Paralympic record but didn't even realise at first. I couldn't see the moment I had finished the race so I didn't know if I was in first place but when I saw on the scoreboard that I was in first place I was so happy Suzuki said.

After my accident my wife was the only person that could make the decision as to whether we would amputate or not amputate. Knowing that my life had always revolved around BMX in particular since I was 10 it was a huge decision because to her that was sort of crushing my dreams. Getting to the Paralympic Games and competing is my way of showing that she made 100 the right decision.      Darren Hicks of Australia in action in Tokyo. Photograph Thomas Peter/Reuters    Did you know It is only since the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and the Winter Olympics of 1992 in Albertville that the Olympics and Paralympics have automatically taken part in the same cities and venues after an agreement between the IPC and IOC. Prior to that the Games would be held in the same year as the Olympics but in different host cities. Key events for Friday 27 August All events are listed here in local Tokyo time.

She is in the rare position of competing in two totally different sports athletics and cycling which has bought additional complications in a Covid-affected Games. She told me My cycling is out in Izu which is three hours away from the village so we are in a different village. I think without Covid I would have been able to use an athletic track here but we've not been able to get access. So I'm doing my training sessions on the golf course. I didn't ever expect to be doing training sessions on the fairway. I'm not sure the people that have to then play golf on it approve of me doing that but it is what it is.     Kadeena Cox in 2017. Photograph Victoria Jones/PA    Cox is one of the ambassadors for a Virgin Media campaign using the hashtag #WeAreHere which is aiming to show public support for ParalympicsGB as their family and friends can't be with them in Japan. Her preparation has been disrupted by injury but she said to me I'm in a really positive place at the moment. I had a few really good sessions before I left to come out here which showed kind of little flecks of where I am but I haven't done the preparation that I wanted. Also in a positive place is Jill Henry from Australia. She contacted me to say I love the Paralympics as I have very fond memories of the two weeks here in Sydney in 2000. All the participants and indeed those not selected to participate as well as their coaches and support deserve the utmost admiration for their courage and resilience.
