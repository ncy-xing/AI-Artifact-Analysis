In early July employers had notified the union of close to 3000 redundancies and layoffs. This has now increased to 5000.  The job losses include redundancies of permanent staff and layoffs of casual workers and zero hours contract staff.  Over half about 2700 are in London and the West End with the rest spread around the country at theatres including Sheffield Theatres Trust Theatre Royal Norwich Nuffield Southampton Theatre Royal Plymouth Lyceum Edinburgh Theatre Royal Newcastle Birmingham Hippodrome Coventry Belgrade and the Pitlochry Festival Theatre. To make matters worse people who remain at theatres face big pay cuts the union warns. The theatre industry employs around 290000 people and 70 of those people are freelance many of whom have fallen through the gaps of the government income support schemes. Head of Bectu Philippa Childs said   The clock is still ticking to save the future of the theatre industry and these figures demonstrate the scale of the crisis it is facing. In July we warned that a storm would turn into a tsunami without further assistance. Despite details of the arts recovery package being announced we are still nowhere closer to the money being distributed. The tsunami we predicted is about to reach our shores as the timeline for action from the government has been too slow and there has been no flexibility for the industry and its access to the furlough scheme. Major industry businesses are releasing their lowest paid staff from the furlough scheme and that trend is only set to continue up the ladder of the workforce.

Brent crude the global benchmark fell as low as $42.89 a barrel and is now flat at $43.56 a barrel while US crude dropped to a low of $39.58 a barrel and is now at $40.22.

Harry Tchilinguirian head of commodity research at BNP Paribas said  Concerns appear to be developing that a rise in Opec+ production will coincide with uneven recovery in oil demand due to localised setbacks following secondary waves of Covid outbreaks.

At the moment investors in open-ended property funds can buy and sell units frequently often daily. But the underlying properties in which these funds invest cannot be bought and sold at the same speed. This creates a liquidity mismatch the FCA explained.  When too many investors simultaneously pull out their investments a fund manager is forced to suspend dealings in the fund as happened with the Woodford and other property funds in the past year. Thousands of investors lost large amounts of money as a result. Christopher Woolard the watchdog's interim chief executive said  We think that our proposals will help further our consumer protection objective by reducing the number of fund suspensions preventing unsuitable purchases of funds and by increasing product efficiency for fund managers. We want open-ended funds to provide a structure through which investors can safely invest in less liquid assets which offer attractive expected returns and at the same time supports investment that benefits the wider economy. We hope the proposed new rules will directly address the liquidity mismatch of these funds making them more resilient during periods of stress and allowing them to operate in a way that all investors are treated equally.

Latest data from retail experts Springboard reveals that footfall at retailers in the UK rose by 2.8 last week from the previous week; a more modest uplift from the week before when shopper numbers climbed 4.4. In England footfall rose by just 2.5 versus gains of more than 4 in each of the other UK nations.  Footfall across UK retail destinations remains more than a third lower than a year ago at -37.6. The figures cover high streets retail parks and shopping centres. Diane Wehrle insights director at Springboard says   The first week of the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail stores in England did not deliver the hoped for uplift in footfall with a rise over the week across the UK that was virtually half of that in the week before.  On high streets footfall rose by 4.3 from the week before while shopping centres were up 1.2 and retail parks posted a 1.4 gain. (This includes a 15.7 drop in high street shopper numbers on Monday when rain hit.)       11.14am BST       Here is a round-up of today's main corporate news. HSBC is to accelerate plans to cut 35000 jobs globally after the Covid-19 crisis forced the bank to put aside another $3.8bn (¬£2.9bn) to cover bad debts which pushed down second-quarter profits by 82 to $1.1bn. The insurer Hiscox has slid into the red after being forced to pay out for cancelled sports events and holidays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The firm which operates in the Lloyd's insurance market set aside $232m for claims related to the crisis up from a previously estimated $175m. It reported a pre-tax loss of $138.9m for the six months to 30 June compared with a profit of $168m a year earlier. It's been a testing six months chief executive Bronek Masojada told Reuters adding that some claims were related to insurance backing travel company refunds in Britain. Some of these companies have gone bust and we are picking up the tab. Like other insurers Hiscox is waiting for the Financial Conduct Authority's test case result in mid-September for further clarity on its business interruption exposure. It maintains that its standard policies do not provide cover for business interruption as a result of lockdown measures taken by the UK government at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hammerson one of Britain's biggest shopping centre owners has confirmed that it is considering raising money from investors and that it is in advanced talks to sell its 50 interest in the outlet centre operator VIA Outlets to its joint venture partner APG.

We are not expecting any changes to the interest rate or the asset-buying programme. At the June meeting the BOE's monetary policy committee kept the Bank rate at 0.1 but pumped a further ¬£100bn into the economy by raising its quantitative easing (QE) programme to ¬£745bn. But the committee also slowed the pace of net gilt purchases to around ¬£6bn a week from ¬£13.5bn previously as liquidity problems in financial markets eased. Philip Shaw chief economist at Investec says  Our expectation is that the votes on both the policy rate and QE will be unanimous in favour of no change'. But we expect the speed of gilt buying to be reined back further. The Bank of England is due to announce the reverse gilt auction sizes beyond 6 August and has hinted that the programme will run more or less to the end of the year. This suggests a weekly gilt purchase rate somewhere close to ¬£4bn per week in order to meet the total ¬£745bn target at that point.  In trying to gauge the policy stance further ahead we expect the committee to note that the economy has enjoyed further recovery momentum recently ... Welcome though this is it of course reflects the response to the gradual unwinding of the lockdown.  What is more critical is how the economy looks towards the end of the year as for example the CJRS (furlough scheme) expires. Moreover members will also note the signs of higher coronavirus infection rates on Continental Europe in the US and to an extent the UK.  The MPC's assessment of the current indicators will probably be one of guarded optimism but tempered strongly by the risks facing the economy further ahead. We think there is a strong chance that the committee sanctions a further ¬£75bn- ¬£100bn of QE in November.      The Bank of England London Britain April 14 2020.

Germany's Dax has fared better advancing 1.3 to 12478 while France's CAC is 0.27 ahead at 4796.  Nicholas Hyett equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown has sent us his thoughts about HSBC  HSBC follows the recent trend with massive provisions for future bad loans knocking profits hard in the first half. There's likely more of that to come and with low interest rates dragging on revenues full year profits will not be pretty. However the bank's made progress on cost control despite pausing redundancies during the peak of the crisis and with the transformation plan expected to pick up pace from here that should soften the blow to the income statement. Meanwhile the suspension of the dividend while a blow to shareholders has strengthened the balance sheet. Having been confirmed as HSBC's permanent CEO in March Noel Quinn's update to the bank's medium term financial targets and dividend policy at the full year will make for interesting reading. Low interest rates are a headwind that's here to stay and a shrinking investment bank makes that more of a challenge. We wouldn't be entirely surprised if that fed through into reduced ambitions on profitability and maybe even a rebased dividend.     Updated at 9.54am BST     9.42am BST       The detail of the UK manufacturing survey reveals Signs of economic recovery and expectations of client confidence strengthening led to improved sentiment among manufacturers during July. Confidence rose to its highest since March 2018 with 62 of companies expecting production to be higher one year from now. Only 12 of firms forecast a contraction. Sentiment strengthened across the consumer intermediate and investment goods industries.  Manufacturing employment fell for the sixth month running in July albeit to the least marked extent since March. Where job cuts were registered it was linked to redundancies natural wastage and aligning capacity with current output needs. Purchasing activity was raised for the first time since last October but stocks of inputs and finished products both fell further. Supply-chain disruption continued. Average input prices rose for the eighth month running in July and at the fastest pace in over a year. The pass-through of higher costs resulted in a further rise in output charges.       9.35am BST    UK factory output grows at fastest rate since 2017 PMI    In the UK factories ramped up production at the fastest rate in nearly three years last month as manufacturers reopened plants after the Covid-19 lockdown. The headline manufacturing PMI from IHS Markit and CIPS rose to 53.3 in July in the final reading compared with the flash estimate of 53.6 and June's 50.1. It was the highest reading since March 2019. The output component improved to 59.3 the highest since November 2017.    Updated at 9.40am BST     9.27am BST       Chris Williamson chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiled the closely-watched survey said  Eurozone factories reported a very positive start to the third quarter with production growing at the fastest rate for over two years fuelled by an encouraging surge in demand. Growth of new orders in fact outpaced production hinting strongly that August should see further output gains. The order book improvement has also helped restore business confidence about the outlook in July to January's pre-pandemic peak.  The job numbers remain a major concern however especially as the labour market is likely to be key to determining the economy's recovery path. Although the rate of job losses eased to the lowest since March it remained greater than at any time since 2009 reflecting widespread cost-cutting in many firms where profits have been hit hard by the virus outbreak. Increased unemployment job insecurity second waves of virus infections and ongoing social distancing measures will inevitably restrain the recovery.        9.26am BST       Spain the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy was the strongest-performing country overall registering its highest PMI reading for over two years. Slower but nonetheless solid gains were seen in France and Austria whilst modest growth was registered in Germany and Italy.  Driving the overall upturn in manufacturing across the eurozone during July were returns to growth in both production and new orders. For output the marked expansion was the first registered by the survey since the start of 2019 whilst the gain seen for new orders was the first in nearly two years and the strongest since early 2018.

The PMI from IHS Markit rose to 51.8 in the final reading better than the flash estimate of 51.1. In June manufacturing was still shrinking with a reading of 47.4 below the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion. The output sub-index improved to 55.3 the highest since April 2018.    Updated at 9.05am BST     9.00am BST       And finally Germany's manufacturing PMI rose to 52 in July better than a preliminary reading of 50 and up from 45.2 in June.  Phil Smith associate economics director at IHS Markit said   The recovery of the German manufacturing sector remains on track with the PMI improving further from April's low and now finally in growth territory. The headline reading of 51.0 is the highest since December 2018 although it actually understates the strength of the rebounds in the underlying measures of output and new orders with the PMI dampened by steep falls in both employment and stocks.  The deep cuts to factory job numbers are a sign that activity and demand are still comfortably down on pre-crisis levels and represent a key headwind to any recovery.  Nevertheless with new orders up sharply in July the immediate outlook for production looks positive and the manufacturing sector remains on course to make a strong contribution to an expected technical rebound in the economy in the third quarter.        8.57am BST       The July reading is up a tad from 52.3 in June.

Foreign demand also remained a source of weakness with new export orders falling further.  Overall July data appear to suggest the sector is on its way to recovery with output expectations also remaining positive.  But after such an extreme blow there is masses of ground to make up. It is essential that demand conditions continue to improve and any reintroduction of lockdown measures due to a second wave of the pandemic has the potential to derail the recovery.        8.47am BST       Italy's manufacturing sector also returned to growth last month.
