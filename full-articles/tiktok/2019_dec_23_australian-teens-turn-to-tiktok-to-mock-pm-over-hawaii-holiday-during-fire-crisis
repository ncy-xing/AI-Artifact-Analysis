Young Australians on social media are mocking Scott Morrison and expressing their anger over his six-day holiday to Hawaii during Australia's bushfire crisis. Morrison returned to work on Sunday cutting his personal family holiday short by a day after transferring responsibilities to the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack last Monday. On Friday the prime minister announced he would return early after the deaths of two firefighters and said he deeply regrets any offence caused by the holiday. But his absence and his lack of action on climate change had already become a meme on Facebook satirical news websites and TikTok the video app popular among teenagers and younger users.

One set to Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire has been viewed more than 120000 times while Morrison was overseas. Another set to Kourtney Kardashian saying Working is not my top priority has racked up more than 42000 views.            The #scomo hashtag which collects many of the videos had more than 1 million combined views by Monday.       Another set to the 2006 song Cry for You by Swedish singer September received 217100 views and 37100 likes and prominently samples a segment where she sings You'll never see me again.                   Young Australians also protested against Morrison's absence on Thursday and Saturday last week in marches outside Kirribilli House. Hundreds set up tents outside the prime minister's Sydney residence on Thursday while 13-year-old Isolde Raj-Seppings was given a move-on direction by police.

A spokesman for the company said it was a human moderation error and reinstated the account of the user 17-year-old Feroza Aziz. In September the Guardian revealed TikTok's internal guidelines told moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square or Tibetan independence. TikTok operates as a separate but identical app called Douyin in China that complies with Chinese censorship laws.
