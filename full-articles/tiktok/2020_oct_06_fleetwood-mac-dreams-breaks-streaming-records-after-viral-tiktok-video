Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams has experienced a huge boost in popularity since being featured in a blissful TikTok video, earning its highest-ever streaming numbers in the US. Idaho labourer Nathan Apodaca, known as 420doggface208 on TikTok, filmed himself skateboarding down a highway drinking cranberry juice and mouthing the Stevie Nicks-sung lyrics to Dreams. Its carefree mood quickly made it viral, with over 23m views so far; Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood later re-created it.   Related: Why is Dreams by Fleetwood Mac back in the charts? And why is everyone skateboarding along to it?    The success of the clip has prompted 8.47m streams of Dreams in the last week in the US, beating the previous high of 3.83m, set in September. The song also returned to the UK charts last week, at No 85. Rumours, the album that features Dreams, returned to the US Top 40 for the first time since 2013, reaching No 27. In the UK, it holds its position from the previous week, No 22. Rumours has spent the last 41 weeks in the UK Top 40, and a total of 856 weeks in the Top 100 since its 1977 release. Apodaca has received thousands of dollars in donations since posting the clip, which he plans to spend on vehicle repairs and upgrades, as well as his parents.
