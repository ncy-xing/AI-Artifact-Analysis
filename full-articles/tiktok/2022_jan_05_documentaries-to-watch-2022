Directed by longtime collaborators Coodie &amp; Chike (Clarence Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah who directed the video for Ye's debut single Through the Wire in 2002 Jeen-yuhs promises never-before-seen footage of Ye's early career.

Maybe 2022 Perhaps the extra couple of years allowed Berg to assemble even more footage than the reportedly 1200 hours he filmed before 2020 during which time the Barbadian singer launched her Fenty beauty line became the first black woman to head a luxury line for LMVH debuted her now staple lingerie line Savage x Fenty started dating fellow musician A$AP Rocky and maintained global superstardom.

No release date has been announced. The Princess      We are reaching peak saturation of Diana content from the disastrous Diana The Musical to the critically acclaimed fourth season of The Crown to Kirsten Stewart's likely Oscar-nominated turn in Pablo Larraín's surreal Spencer. Now comes Ed Perkins’ The Princess premiering at Sundance with an HBO Max streaming date to be announced which purports to examine the life of the People's Princess and her influence on the public's view of the monarchy both during her life and long after her death in 1997. Lucy and Desi      Amy Poehler's documentary debut produced by Ron Howard examines the life of the groundbreaking comedian Lucille Ball and her intense devoted partnership with husband and I Love Lucy co-star Desi Arnaz. Poehler who has directed the feature films Wine Country and Moxie took on her first non-fiction project as a longtime fan of Ball. It was inspired by her story and what kind of woman she was in business and what kind of culture she was in when she was making the show she told Variety in 2020 as well as the interesting and complicated and loving relationship with Arnaz. Here's hoping reviews are stronger than for last year's coolly received Being the Ricardos Aaron Sorkin's feature starring Nicole Kidman as Ball and (controversially) Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the Cuban American Arnaz.
