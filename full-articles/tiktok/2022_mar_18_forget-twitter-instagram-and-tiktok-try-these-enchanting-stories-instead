I am not acquainted with Twitter, Instagram or TikTok and their feelgood social media accounts (Stop doomscrolling! The 50 cheeriest social media accounts – from dancing academics to seal pups, 15 March), but anyone who feels that “everything is terrible” should join the thousands of us worldwide for whom the Gentle Author’s blog – spitalfieldslife.com – is our daily treat. Readers’ comments on the blog reflect the joy which the beautiful writing brings, the excitement of first stumbling upon it, the elegance and compassion of the writing, the humanising effect of the enchanting stories. Read, and it makes the world a better place.Josephine EglinNorton St Philip, Somerset • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
