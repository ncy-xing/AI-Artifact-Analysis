     In February, a clip of Louis Theroux performing a gentle, self-penned rap went viral from TikTok, AutoTuned, remixed and set to a dance (naturally). But how did he brag – in a very Louis way – about his good fortunes?
      
       “My money don’t jiggle jiggle, it folds”
       “From Weird Weekends to wealthy weekdays”
       “Theroux with my mortgage, thanks BBC Two”
       “My Scientology Movie made me L Ron Rich”
      
     “The slap” at the Oscars resonated around the world – and was metabolised into memes at record speed. But which peripheral celebrity’s take went viral as the last word on the row?

     This year, social media turned its collective brainpower towards one big question: wheels or doors – which are there more of in the world? An Australian radio show roped in a mathematician to find an answer, once and for all – but what was it?
      
       There are more doors
       There are more wheels
       There are exactly the same number of wheels and doors
       The problem is insoluble by mathematics
      
     Early in the year people were reporting themselves to be going “goblin mode”. But what exactly did it mean?
      
       Emptying your bank accounts and stashing all your cash at home
       <li class="question__answer answer" data-text="Wearing only the oldest clothes you own

     In May, a Reddit user’s post about their “wild” experience at a Swedish friend’s family home sparked a lively cross-cultural debate later dubbed “Swedengate”. But, in the Swede’s disputed dinner-time faux pas, what was the guest asked to do?
      
       Wait alone in his room while he and his family ate dinner
       Bring his own food 
       Bring enough food for the whole family
       Provide the evening’s entertainment
      
     Don’t Worry Darling was a decidedly middling film, but the reported drama behind-the-scenes made for rich online speculation and many great memes. But what outlandish rumour got such traction that it prompted an official rebuttal?
      
       Harry Styles spat on Chris Pine (allegedly)
       Florence Pugh punched Olivia Wilde (allegedly) 
       Gemma Chan ghost-wrote the script (allegedly)
       Nick Kroll and Harry Styles kissed (allegedly)
      
     After a months-long rigmarole, Elon Musk finally bought Twitter and now seems intent on running it into the ground. On his first day, what was he seen taking into Twitter HQ, for some reason?
      
       A bucket, for bailing the company out
       A sink, for making a splash
       A steering wheel, as proof that he’s behind it
       A megaphone, for amplifying free speech
      
     If 2021 spelled the end of the “girlboss”, 2022 saw the “wife guy” go the same way, with several celebrities who had made their happy marriages central to their public profiles (allegedly!) caught cheating. Shabby stuff! But at least Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine’s (alleged!) sexts caused widespread mirth online for their decidedly PG content. Which of the below was not one of Levine’s (alleged!) real lines?
      
       “I may need to see the booty”
       “I need you in my bed”
       “It is truly unreal how hot you are”
       “You are 50 times hotter in person”
