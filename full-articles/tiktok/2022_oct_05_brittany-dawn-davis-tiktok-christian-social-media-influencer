Around 5pm in Fort Worth Texas as the April evening sun splashed angelic beams of light across the event space's concrete walls Brittany Dawn Davis began baptizing women in a horse trough. Wearing a black sweatshirt stamped with the word mercy a nod to a local megachurch Mercy Culture and her white-blond hair extensions tied in a loose ponytail Davis dunked woman after woman into the cold water as cheers of woo erupted from onlookers. Most of the women looked younger than 30 years old. Some shivered; some wept and smiled as they received their blessing. A live band playing soft music served as a backdrop for the many videos and reels being filmed all soon to be posted to Instagram and TikTok.       Social media is after all where this crowd came to know their baptizer the Christian social media influencer known as Brittany Dawn. The nearly 100 women in the room had traveled from across the country Tennessee Florida Colorado and as far as upstate New York for a daylong retreat to meet their role model. For the past several years Davis has served her combined 1.7 million followers (1 million on TikTok alone) daily doses of Christian content Bible verses on her signature millennial beige backdrop tips on dressing modestly and videos on the importance of saving sex for marriage. As a Tammy Faye for the TikTok generation Davis is selling her version of Christianity and a lot of merch everything from Bible highlighters to self-tanner protein cookies teeth whitener and false eyelashes. The retreats are one of her bigger ticket items ranging from $125 (£109) to $650 (£568). Davis isn't new to this game. In her former life as a fitness influencer a past that has embroiled her in an upcoming $1m lawsuit and accusations of con artistry Davis sold everything from coaching to athletic socks. She has since entirely rebranded and chosen to become a spiritual guru to her many followers. Where she once posted quad exercises Davis's Instagram bio now reads wildly in love with Jesus and writer of truth-filled captions. But truth especially in the US is often inextricable from belief. Brittany Dawn Davis succeeds not because she tells the truth but because she tells a good story.
