As TikTok claims it would never hand over user information on Australian users to foreign governments, the company’s own transparency reporting reveals hundreds of instances where user data has been handed over to governments. The short video app popular with a younger demographic and used by some 1 billion people worldwide has been the subject of intense scrutiny over concerns its Beijing-based company ByteDance could be handing over data about its users to the Chinese government. India has banned the app while the US has hinted at a similar ban. TikTok went on the offensive this week in Australia, writing letters to every federal politician and placing full-page newspaper ads claiming the app was being used as “a political football” in the ongoing disputes with China.

We’re an open book about this.” On Friday Scott Morrison told the Melbourne radio station 3AW he was “mindful” of the risks potentially posed by the app and said they were being monitored closely. “If we consider there is a need to take further action than we are taking now, then I can tell you we won’t be shy about it,” the prime minister said. Hunter said user data, which for Australia is held in Singapore and the US, would not be handed over: “The Chinese government and any foreign government has never asked for our data [and] even if they did ask for that we would refuse to give it to them.” “It’s a very, very clear global mandate that we have, which we’re not just saying in Australia but we’re saying around the world … user data and information is stored confidentially – it’s not shared with any other companies or government agencies and it’s not our intention to ever do so.” But the company’s own transparency report reveals TikTok complying with hundreds of requests a year from foreign governments for user information, videos, user interactions and log data. India had a 90% success rate for its more than 400 requests to TikTok in the last six months of 2019. The US had an 82% success rate from more than 100 requests, while Australia made two requests, both of which were rejected. There were no requests listed from China, and although there is nothing in the guidelines preventing foreign governments requesting user data, it would be subject to the mutual legal assistance request framework of the country requesting the data. When asked about this, Hunter referred to the separate content removal requests, and said TikTok worked with the applicable laws of the countries it operated in. “With Australia I want to be clear that we don’t provide access to user data with any government authorities,” he said. “We do look to work with the applicable laws of the country, to make sure that we’re protecting our users, but we do that on a case by case basis, again, everything in aid of what is the best for the users on the platform.” Ownership options The gay dating app Grindr has shifted its ownership back from China to the US after US politicians raising concerns about national security implications. Hunter indicated one potential option could be to structure TikTok so it was not owned by a company located in China – an option also flagged by the White House adviser Larry Kudlow. “We’re looking at a number of different ways in which we might serve the users and our creators and partners better, be it through corporate structures or any other means we’re looking at a number of things around that,” he said.
