The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air attraction that tells the story of Britain's early manufacturing history set in the defiantly unstarry town of Dudley in England's industrial Midlands. Among the exhibits that have earned it a clutch of awards are two mine shafts a lime kiln and a collection of postwar trolley buses. This month the visitor attraction gained another more unexpected accolade becoming it believes the most popular museum in the world on TikTok. It has more than 350000 followers worldwide and its short video clips often featuring a cast of re-enactors in historic dress can attract many more viewers. A recent video featuring a character called 1920s grandad offering advice in a tar-thick Black Country accent has been viewed more than 2.2m times. My favourite TikTok account giving me LIFE right now reads one of the clip's almost 12000 comments.     Filming of 1920s grandad’ which has been viewed more than 2.2m times.

Abby Bird the museum's communications manager admits she had no expectation of such popularity when she launched the TikTok account in late August. I remember thinking I would be really happy if we got 10000 followers by Christmas she says. In fact she cleared that hurdle after only her second post a video of some of the museum's actors strutting through its historic streets to a booming K-pop soundtrack in parody of a street-style meme popular on the site. The museum has been named one of TikTok's 100 top UK accounts for 2020 and after extensive searching Bird can find no other museum in the world with more followers.

Bird 31 is a self-confessed TikTok addict but not all her colleagues got it at first. Once I explained the process to senior staff they were very much like Well I don't really understand how it works and I don't use it personally but I trust you.’ Part of us being accessible as a museum is being in the spaces that young people are digitally. That challenge is well understood by Adam Koszary who had a brief and surreal moment of internet celebrity in 2018 when he was social media manager of the Museum of Rural English Life. One of his tweets featuring an impressively proportioned sheep became such a huge global meme that the billionaire Tesla-founder Elon Musk briefly changed his profile picture to that of the museum. Now in charge of social media for the Royal Academy in London Koszary frequently advises other museums and galleries seeking to make their communications more effective. It is ironic he says that despite being in the business of telling stories many are still playing catchup to social media in a ton of ways. Even if they have massive followings they're still not quite connecting. Both he and Bird agree that the key is in what Koszary calls meeting the internet halfway taking time to discover what works on different platforms and committing the resources to make the institution's content and tone translate to that medium.

Koszary points to the National Trust as an institution that has done an amazing job balancing its members’ interest in nature and history with the need to communicate its properties’ sometimes controversial backstories. The question is how to translate a viral following on social media into real value. I suppose it really depends on how you define success as a museum says Bird. Just because our doors are closed at the moment that doesn't mean our job stops. We're focusing on visits to the website conversations happening the number of comments all of those are really important indicators that people are taking in the story. And I have absolute confidence that that is going to lead to more visits.
