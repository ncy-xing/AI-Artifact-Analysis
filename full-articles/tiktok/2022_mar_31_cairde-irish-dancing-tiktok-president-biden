‘Our St Patrick’s Day is like Christmas to Michael Bublé,” says Dara Kelly of the viral Irish dancing group Cairde. “Three years ago, it was so much more relaxed and chill for everyone. But now, it’s debatably the busiest time of the year for us.” The seven dancers from the west of Ireland have just returned from the US where they performed at their most prestigious gig yet: a private reception at the White House with Joe Biden sat in the front row. Cairde, which is Irish for “friends”, is made up of Dara Kelly and Ronan O’Connell, both 20, Ethan Quinton, Stephen McGuinness, Brian Culligan and Seamus Morrison, all 21, and Francis Fallon, 22. After many years of Irish dancing competitively, the group of best friends first came up with the idea for Cairde in 2017. But it wasn’t until they made a TikTok account in July 2020 that it became official. “We were literally doing it for the craic,” Culligan says. “And then once we had a few big videos, we said, ‘Let’s actually really commit ourselves to this.’” The dancers, who live together in Galway, now have more than 3m followers across all their social media platforms. With Irish dancing’s huge boom on TikTok over the past two years, it’s unsurprising that Cairde quickly found an audience. They have won fans from all over the world with their catchy, synchronised rhythms choreographed to tracks by the likes of Ed Sheeran, Shakira and Abba, in locations ranging from Times Square and the Eiffel Tower to the famous Temple Bar in Dublin. But their most popular viral video – a snappy, 16-second routine to the Banjo Beat TikTok sound – was filmed closer to home, on four boards from the woods in Galway. It currently has 89m views.

Last month, they danced for their biggest audience yet at the France v Ireland Six Nations halftime show at the Stade de France, offering them a tangible perspective of the sheer reach their social media videos have. “There were 81,000 people in the audience and we were just absolutely blown away by the reaction from that and the capacity,” Culligan says. “And then we started thinking, if we got that many views on a video, we’d be sickened. 80,000 is nothing,” he laughs, struggling to grasp the huge numbers on some of their videos. But Cairde’s career highlight would unfold in front of one of their smallest audiences. After a St Patrick’s Day performance on Good Morning America that was broadcast live from the Cliffs of Moher, county Clare, last year, Cairde were contacted to perform at the 2022 Ireland Funds Gala in Washington DC. “If we had gone over there and just done that, we would have been on cloud nine,” Culligan says. But the group were then invited to dance in the White House, too. They would get not one, but two standing ovations from Joe Biden for their performance at his private St Patrick’s Day celebration. “Princess Diana danced with John Travolta in there,” Culligan says, “and now Cairde have done it, too.” So, what was going through their heads as they danced for the president of the United States? “Basically just not to hit him with the front click!” Kelly says. “He was right in front of us.”              At the drinks reception afterwards, the president approached the group. “You guys are incredible!” he told them with his arm draped around Morrison, pulling him in close. “I don’t have one third of the athletic ability.” As Cairde reflect on the honour of the performance, they struggle to put into words what it means. “To see President Biden be the first one on his feet, that’s a moment that’s going to be with me for the rest of my life,” Quinton says. “It will take something absolutely crazy, like if we dance on the moon, to top that.” While Cairde built their name online, the recent string of live performances have reminded them where their true passion lies. “At the end of the day, we’re still dancers and what we want to do is just be on stage all the time,” Quinton says. Culligan agrees: “I do think we probably all get more of a buzz off a 500-person audience than we do a million views on a video.” While some of the group have danced professionally with productions like Riverdance and Lord of the Dance, the dream for Cairde is to perform in their own show, plans for which they insist are “very much under way”. After their White House performance, the seven dancers huddled together on stage for a group hug. I ask them what was the first thing they said to each other when they had a chance to debrief. “I think straight away we said, ‘You know what? Fair play to us,” Culligan says. “I think we’re on to a good one here.”
