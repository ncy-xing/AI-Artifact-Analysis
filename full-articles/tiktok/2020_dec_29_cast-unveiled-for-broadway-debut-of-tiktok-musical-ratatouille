The star of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and 30 Rock, Tituss Burgess, will play the role of Remy the rat in the highly anticipated debut of Ratatouille, ‚Äúthe TikTok musical‚Äù. The cast of the unlikely musical phenomenon, which tells the story of a gastronomically blessed French rat, was announced on Monday. As reported by the Guardian in October, the musical is a crowd-created phenomenon with no set creator, and began as an internet meme based on the 2007 Pixar animated film. Now, in a series of events as unlikely as a Parisian rat becoming an acclaimed chef, it will be staged as a one-off charity performance, to be livestreamed online. Unlike a traditional musical, the Ratatouille performance has no single creator, or any canonical music or lyrics. The 1 January performance is a collection of popular videos shared on TikTok, placed in a running order, and performed by established Broadway musical theatre stars, accompanied by the 20-piece Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra.

The Whose Line Is It Anyway? regular Wayne Brady will play Remy‚Äôs father Django, the singer Adam Lambert will play Remy‚Äôs brother Emile, and Andrew Barth Feldman will play Alfredo Linguini, the human apprentice chef that Remy controls. The Emily in Paris actor Ashley Park will play the no-nonsense sous chef Colette Tatou, and Tony nominee Mary Testa will play the antagonist Skinner. The Tony winner Priscilla Lopez will play the role of Mabel, an old lady who attempts to shoot Remy with a gun, whose role in the musical is greatly expanded from that in the film.

Related: Crowd-created TikTok phenomenon Ratatouille the musical is coming to Broadway    After an initial post from teacher Emily Jacobsen earlier this year, social media users began writing their own original songs for a hypothetical Ratatouille musical, based on the film. Fans wrote brand new songs, reimagining scenes, characters and plot points from the film. While other Disney films have been granted official musical remakes ‚Äì such as Beauty and the Beast, Frozen and The Lion King ‚Äì Ratatouille had until now been snubbed. The original voice of Remy, actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, gave the musical his blessing when it was announced. ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 30 December 2020. The headline and text of a previous version incorrectly suggested that this virtual production would be performed on a Broadway stage. A reference to the involvement of the Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra was also added.
