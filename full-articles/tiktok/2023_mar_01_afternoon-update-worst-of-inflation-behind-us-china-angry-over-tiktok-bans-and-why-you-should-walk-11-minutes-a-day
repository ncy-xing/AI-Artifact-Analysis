The economy is losing steam, inflation is beginning to ease and unemployment is up – three trends the Reserve Bank wants to see as it considers a 10th consecutive hike to interest rates. 
Australia’s GDP grew 0.5% in the December quarter, slower than the 0.8% tipped by economists, while inflation in January was 7.4% – down from 8.4% in December and short of the 8.1% predicted by economists. Unemployment also rose in January from 3.5% to 3.7%. 
“I’m confident the worst of inflation is behind us rather than ahead of us,” the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said. 
Will it be enough to convince the RBA not to raise interest rates next week? Probably not, according to our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, who said: “The RBA remains an odds-on favourite to lift its key interest rate when its board meets next Tuesday. At its February rates meeting, the RBA made it clear more interest rate rises were in the works and it would be require an abrupt change of course for them to avert a 10th rate rise in a row next week.”

 China hits back over TikTok bans | The US decision to ban Chinese-owned TikTok on government devices is “abusing state power”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson has said. China – which itself has banned YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram – said the US was showing its insecurities by fearing “a young person’s favourite app”. Canada joined the US on the ban this week, while the Australian treasurer Jim Chalmers today said Canberra would look to national security agencies to decide whether to follow suit.

“Let’s talk about our whole tax system. Not just one tax at a time … We need to consider other tax options. For example – what about a minerals resource rent tax for future mining?” – Allegra Spender 
Tax is all the rave in Canberra this week, after the government announced its plan to change superannuation tax concessions. While the right have attacked Labor’s tweak to super, independents such as Spender want the government to go beyond superannuation, noting the huge profits made by fossil fuel companies in the wake of the Ukraine war.

Modern science and ancient mythology have found a point of convergence on whales. 
Old Norse mythology refers to a large sea creature – the hafgufa – that lies still with its mouth open waiting for fish to hop right in. A maritime archaeologist at Flinders University in Adelaide has recently discovered the ancient texts were describing – albeit more colourfully – a whale feeding technique that scientists have only documented in recent years.
