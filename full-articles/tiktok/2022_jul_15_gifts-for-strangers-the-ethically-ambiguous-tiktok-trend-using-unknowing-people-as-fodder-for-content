Picture the scene. You're sitting alone enjoying a coffee. Maybe you've got a podcast on. Maybe you're on the phone to your mum. Enter a random person clutching a bunch of flowers. Would you be able to hold this they ask before gliding away content in the knowledge they've just made your day (probably). A Melbourne TikTok creator has received wide backlash for a viral video described as dehumanising and artificial by its subject Maree. The video which Maree claimed was filmed without her consent captured her shocked reaction after being given a bouquet of flowers in a busy shopping centre from a stranger. The video is just the tip of the iceberg for this TikTok trend. There are thousands of random acts of kindness videos on the social media platform with billions of views globally.

It's the money shot she says. The one moment of charity that runs and re-loops tugging at the heartstrings. You'll never regret being kind’ TOM a Sydney based TikTok user has almost 7 million social media followers and more than 200m likes for his kyndness content which features so-called selfless acts such as giving away items complimenting fits and learning how to do eyebrow extensions for his girlfriend. In many of his videos TOM is filmed hovering behind random unsuspecting shoppers only to float by and pay for their groceries with a swipe of his card to their bemusement and in some cases distaste. That's ridiculous one woman says. Get fucked another cries.     TOM You'll never regret being kind   In some videos TOM gives away items nobody asked for like flowers or in one case a PS5 to a man eating an ice-cream in a park. Nah the man says and walks away. On his personal website TOM encourages viewers to donate to make every video possible and impact people's lives dramatically. In other videos TOM stands on a kerb in crutches or pretending he is blind. Would you HELP someone if they asked these videos are captioned fading to black when people look at him and shrug.     TOM Would you HELP someone if they asked   Abidin says the genre of shame levity has existed on social media for more than a decade. Its origins are in citizen journalism when users would film poor behaviour in public like young people taking up seats on a train or dangerous drivers. This evolved into the random acts of kindness genre which Abidin calls humanitarian dramas. It started on YouTube … these agonising conundrums to draw out the benevolence of everyday heroes she says. Using the canvas of everyday people. Which is why she says they reinforce stereotypes.

In the comments there's an overtly positive optimistic tone about how it's a good trend. It doesn't leave space for reflection or for people who may not want to receive these handouts or this type of help publicly. We don't know if they feel embarrassment or humiliation because that's how video is framed without much further context. I invited him in and gave him food’ People experiencing homelessness are often the targets of donors in viral content who use hashtags like #foryou #give and #homeless. One creator primenaz films himself dropping money in front of people then if they attempt to return it he gives them additional notes. In other videos he gives out food and hides cash in a convenience store he appears to work at or challenges customers to respond to maths questions correctly to get $100. She Said She Didn't Eat For 2 Days So I Let Her Pick Whatever She Wants And Gave Her $100 is the caption of one video with more than 10m views.     primenaz He Was Looking At The Food So I Invited Him In And Gave Him Food I Also Hid Some Cash For Him   The dilemma Abidin says is these people can't say no to unwanted virality.
