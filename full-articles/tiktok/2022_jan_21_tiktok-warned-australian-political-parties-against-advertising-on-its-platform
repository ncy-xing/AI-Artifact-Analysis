TikTok wrote to Australian political parties in November last year warning them against attempting to pay influencers or engage in any other sort of advertising on its platform Guardian Australia can reveal. Just months out from the next federal election the letters were sent after Crikey reported a US-based marketing agency had emailed a campaign brief to a TikTok user offering $300 for the user to make and post a video on the theme of Scott Morrison is too slow and always late. When the Labor leader Anthony Albanese was asked on Thursday about the November report he told radio station 6PR he wasn't familiar with it. Well it is the first I've heard of it. But it wouldn't be too hard for people to post TikTok videos along that theme. Because that is a theme that is characterised by this government. That is what we hear back he said.

You don't need any incentive to encourage people to put things on social media of a partisan nature against the PM against me against Clive Palmer against anyone. That's one of the facts of what happens with social media. While politicians are allowed to use TikTok they are not allowed to advertise on the platform under TikTok's branded content policy. Unlike other platforms such as Facebook and YouTube TikTok does not allow advertising for political content. Our advertising policies are strict. On TikTok in Australia we do not allow ads for alcohol gambling or political parties and causes Brent Thomas TikTok's director of public policy in Australia and New Zealand told a parliamentary committee on social media and online safety on Thursday. This policy was questioned at the hearing by United Australia Party leader Craig Kelly whose party has been spending millions in advertising on other platforms. Thomas replied that TikTok is primarily an entertainment platform and while political commentary is allowed political advertising is not. We want to make sure that as long as the content that is uploaded adheres to our community guidelines it's absolutely OK. But where it is a paid political advertising component That's where we draw the line. So I could advertise McDonald's but I couldn't advertise the Republican party in the US Kelly asked.
