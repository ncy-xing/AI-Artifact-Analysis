ComSore has just released the first stats from its new world-wide search analysis, and as you can see, Google is overwhelmingly dominant with 37bn out of the 61bn total (61%). Yahoo is miles behind (14%) and the rest are nowhere. [corrected] The figures for Microsoft (3.5%) are particularly bad. It's already behind China's Baidu and could be overtaken by South Korea's NHN Corporation. It's probably no consolation that Ask Network is doing even worse. Of course, Asia is now the biggest market for search, followed by Europe, with North America third. ComScore has the numbers:  The Asia-Pacific region, which includes large markets such as China, Japan and India, saw 258 million unique searchers conduct 20.3 billion searches. Europe reported the second-most searchers (210 million) and searches (18 billion), followed by North America, with 206 million searchers and 16 billion searches.   The numbers are for those aged 15+ and do not include traffic from public computers such as Internet cafes or access from mobile phones or PDAs.
