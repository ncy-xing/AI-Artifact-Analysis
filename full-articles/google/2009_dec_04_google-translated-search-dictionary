Google is now rolling out a new feature which it calls Translated Search. The Official Google Blog post Searching the global web just got a little easier says   Translated search is great because it helps you find information from sites written in other languages. We've offered this feature in Google Translate for a while but now we're integrating it fully into Google search making it easier for you to find and read results from pages across the web even if they weren't written in a language you speak.  It's not obvious. To use the feature you have to click the "Show optionsâ€¦" link then look at the bottom of the menu column for "Translated search". Which in my case I have not got.  Google says "You can display results for up to five languages at once and select from 51 languages to search." Google has also made it easier to translate words between multiple languages though this feature is presented as a dictionary at http//www.google.com/dictionary. If you're lucky with your look-up this will give you a result from what seems to be an actual Google dictionary. In most of the cases I tried however the dictionary only offered "Web definitions" -- links to words looked up on a subset of web sites. You could do something like this yourself using Google Custom Search.  Of course if Google has a definition for a word you were already able to get it on the main search page by clicking on the [definition] link visible in lines such as  Results 1 - 10 of about 29300000 for dictionary [definition]. (0.11 seconds)  If the [definition] link isn't there then you might as well go to http//dictionary.reference.com/ and get a good quality result. If it is there then clicking it takes you to http//www.google.com/dictionary anyway. So why didn't Google just buy a decent dictionary It's not like they couldn't afford it and Google's obviously not averse to buying companies it's picked up dozens including Blogger YouTube Picasa Android FeedBurner Keyhole (Google Earth) Last (Google Sketchup) Applied Semantics (Google AdSense) Urchin (Google Analytics) JotSpot and Writely (Google Docs). Perhaps it will one day. At the moment however the attraction of Google.com/dictionary is that as I said it makes it easier to translate words between multiple languages. You can for example enter a word then choose English-French or English-Hindi or whatever and get the equivalent. It's certainly worth bearing that in mind for the times you might need it.
