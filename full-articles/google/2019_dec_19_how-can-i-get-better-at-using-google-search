Last week's column mentioned search skills. I'm sometimes on the third page of results before I get to what I was really looking for. I'm sure a few simple tips would find these results on page 1. All advice welcome. Michael  Google achieved its amazing popularity by de-skilling search. Suddenly people who were not very good at searching which is almost everyone could get good results without entering long complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important based on its PageRank algorithm and it knew which pages were most effective because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn't deliver what they wanted. Later Google added personalisation based on factors such as your location your previous searches your visits to other websites and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns because your searches into physical and mental health issues legal and social problems relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else or even a machine to know. When talking about avoiding the creepy line former Google boss Eric Schmidt said We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about. Google hasn't got to that point yet but it does want to save you from typing. Today Google does this through a combination of auto-complete search suggestions Answer Boxes and People also ask boxes which show related questions along with their feature snippets. As a result Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research about half of browser-based searches no longer result in a click and about 6 go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps. You could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers not pages of links. So I can give you some search tips but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in January 2004 or perhaps not for as long. Advanced Search for everyone     Google's advanced search page is the tool to properly drill down into the results. Photograph Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    The easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the Advanced Search page though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words). You can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language region website or domain or to a type of file how recently it was published and so on. Of course nobody wants to fill in forms. However using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below and it's a fallback if you forget any. Happily many commands work on other search engines too so skills are transferable. Use quotation marks     Quotation marks can be a powerful tool to specify exact search terms. Photograph IKEA    If you are looking for something specific quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will of course ignore this but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist but you will get fewer or perhaps no results. Putting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect and is useful for finding quotations people's names book and film titles or particular phrases. You can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example The Simpsons episode Deep Space Homer popularised the phrase I for one welcome our new insect overlords. Searching for I for one welcome our new * overlords finds other overlords such as aliens cephalopods computers robots and squirrels. Nowadays Google's RankBrain is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks even if they include stop words such as a at that the and this. You don't need quotation marks to search for the Force The Who or The Smiths. However it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don't want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car. Use site commands     Using the siteâ€™ command can be a powerful tool for quickly searching a particular website. Photograph Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    Google also has a site command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or with a minus sign (-site) exclude it. This command uses the site's uniform resource locator or URL. For example if you wanted to find something on the Guardian's website you would type sitetheguardian.com (no space after the colon) alongside your search words. You may not need to search the whole site. For example sitetheguardian.com/technology/askjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online though it doesn't search all the ancient texts (continued on p94). There are several similar commands. For example inurl will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their SEO (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle to find words in titles. Web pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title it should be one of the page's main topics. You can also use site and inurl commands to limit searches to include or exclude whole groups of websites. For example either siteco.uk or inurlco.uk will search matching UK websites though many UK sites now have .com addresses. Similarly siteac.uk and inurlac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions while inurledu and siteedu will find American ones. Using inurlac.uk OR inurledu (the Boolean command must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using sitegov.uk will find British government websites and inurlhttps will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers. Google Search can also find different types of file using either filetype or ext (for file extension). These include office documents (docx pptx xlxs rtf odt odp odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example a search for picasso filetypepdf is more productive than one for stormzy. Make it a date     Narrowing your search by date can find older pieces. Photograph Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    We often want up-to-date results particularly in technology where things that used to be true are not true any more. After you have run a search you can use Google's time settings to filter the results or use new search terms. To do this click Tools click the down arrow next to Any time and use the dropdown menu to pick a time period between Past hour and Past year. Last week I was complaining that Google's freshness algorithm could serve up lots of blog-spam burying far more useful hits. Depending on the topic you can use a custom time range to get less fresh but perhaps more useful results. Custom time settings are even more useful for finding contemporary coverage of events which might be a company's public launch a sporting event or something else. Human memories are good at rewriting history but contemporaneous reports can provide a more accurate picture. However custom date ranges have disappeared from mobile the daterange command no longer seems to work in search boxes and sort by date has gone except in news searches. Instead this year Google introduced before and after commands to do the same job. For example you could search for Apple iPod before2002-05-31 after2001-10-15 for a bit of nostalgia. The date formats are very forgiving so one day we may all prefer it. Have you got a question Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com
