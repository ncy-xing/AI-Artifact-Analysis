Internet giant Google has deployed a seasonal touch to its search engine greeting at least one festive query with a decorative flurry of snow. In the latest of a long line of tweaks to the service users searching for "let it snow" are greeted to a decorative cascade of snowflakes in their browser. In a further twist as the flakes continue to fall the list of returned links begins to frost over. The list including YouTube videos of Dean Martin Frank Sinatra and Kylie Minogue singing Let It Snow is restored to full visibility by clicking on a "defrost" button that eventually appears. Google regularly swaps its traditional multi-coloured logo with 'doodles' celebrating key dates or the lives of cult or influential figures.
