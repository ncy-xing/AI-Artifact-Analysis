Internet giant Google has deployed a seasonal touch to its search engine, greeting at least one festive query with a decorative flurry of snow. In the latest of a long line of tweaks to the service, users searching for "let it snow" are greeted to a decorative cascade of snowflakes in their browser. In a further twist, as the flakes continue to fall, the list of returned links begins to frost over. The list – including YouTube videos of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Kylie Minogue singing Let It Snow – is restored to full visibility by clicking on a "defrost" button that eventually appears. Google regularly swaps its traditional multi-coloured logo with 'doodles' celebrating key dates or the lives of cult or influential figures.
