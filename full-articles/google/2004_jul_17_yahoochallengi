"Use of Yahoo as a search engine ties that of the mighty Google in the most recent Consumer Technographics survey, sponsored by Forrester, of more than 60,000 North American households. Each of those search engines shows up with 40 percent of Web surfers who use a portal or search site at least once a week. And Forrester believes use of Yahoo search will surge ahead of Google in the first quarter of 2005, says George Colony, Forrester chair and CEO," reports PC World. "Colony says a great search site has three components: personalization, presentation, and quality of service. 'Of all the search engines out there, Yahoo is the only player that gets all three.'"
