Google’s search website suffered an intermittent outage on Friday morning that prevented users from conducting searches or accessing services through the main Google website. The website went offline with a “500” error at 10.30am on Friday morning, affecting computer browsers. The mobile Google website, accessed via smartphones and tablets, were unaffected, as were the Google mobile search apps and Google Now. Google’s other services, including Gmail and Google Calendar were not affected. “500. That’s an error,” said the Google error page. “The server encountered an error and could not complete your request.” “If the problem persists, please report your problem and mention this error message and the query that caused it. That’s all we know,” it continued. The error message 500 indicates that Google is suffering an internal server error. Both the google.com and google.co.uk websites were suffering intermittent outages at the time of writing. Google could not be contacted for comment. Web users were quick to take to Twitter and highlight the outage.    Tbh Google&#39;s been having lots of short outages the last few weeks. Couple of minutes max, every now and again.
