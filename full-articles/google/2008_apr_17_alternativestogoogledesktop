I'm running Windows XP and have been using Google Desktop to search my PC, as I find the Windows text/file search within Explorer to be close to useless. However, I have experienced some problems and our IT people have suggested that I remove it, as it has been implicated in several other machines running slowly or doing rather strange things. Can you suggest alternative search software? Richard Hartley I loved Google Desktop Search, but have also given up on it. Copernic Desktop Search is the obvious upgrade, and well worth a try. However, the search built into Vista is very good, and Microsoft is trying to provide the same facilities for XP. You could try Windows Desktop Search 3.01 for Windows XP or the new Search 4.0 Preview version. It's available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions for XP SP2, Vista and Windows Server 2003. Your IT people will love the Group Policy integration. All these programs need a few hours to do the initial indexing of your hard drive.
