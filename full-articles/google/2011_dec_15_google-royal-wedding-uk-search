A royal wedding a briefly-wedded celebrity a Twilight film and a TV series arguably in the twilight of its existence all topped the list of "fast-rising" searches in the UK according to Googlelatest "Zeitgeist" lists. Thus the royal wedding and its principal star Kate Middleton (though not her sister Pippa) rank highest in the new searches for this year collected by the search engine which dominates search in this country. Second on the list was an object that didn't exist Apple's fabled "iPhone 5" expected all year long to be unveiled in June then July then August then September until the company finally in October unveiled … the iPhone 4S. The company also appears for its iPad 2 product after the first version appeared in the top 10 last year. The impact of video games on our lives is also clear Fifa 12 and the online game Minecraft both appear in the new "rising searches". Meanwhile Ryan Dunn the Jackass star who died in a car crash and the singers Adele Rebecca Black and Ed Sheeran all appear compared with the lone human appearance of Justin Bieber as a name among the new searches last year. (Bieber can rest easy he has now crossed over to become one of the most searched-for news terms.) Kim Kardashian whose short-lived wedding made her news fodder everywhere was the most searched-for celebrity in the UK. She was followed by Victoria Beckham Harry Potter star Emma Watson Scarlett Johansson Jennifer Aniston the ever-present Britney Spears Megan Fox Ricky Gervais (the only male on the list apparently on the strength of his Golden Globes presenter spot) Jessica Jane and Angelina Jolie. Among films Breaking Dawn one of the Twilight saga set the pattern in which remakes ruled. It was the most searched-for new film followed by a rash of franchise films Final Destination 5 Mean Girls 2 True Grit (a remake) Conan The Barbarian (another remake) Scream 4 The Inbetweeners (an original UK film) Little Fockers (third in the franchise) Transformers 3 and Unstoppable - the only other original film on the list. Meanwhile "X Factor 2011" was the fastest-rising search despite its sliding TV ratings compared with last year. After that came the Apprentice 2011 X Factor USA and then NCIS House Glee Thundercats Big Brother Supernatural and Smallville. It's unclear if people searching for the US series names are trying to find download links or information about them; Google said it doesn't have any insight into that. For deputy prime minister Nick Clegg the news that the top "what is…" search was "what is AV" (answer the alternative vote system the Liberal Democrats were proposing to replace first-past-the-post elections) will confirm why the referendum was lost too few people could understand it without resorting to the internet. But they're also judging by the other "what is" search terms puzzled by sauteed shrimp ("what is scampi") underground fungus and/or chocolates ("what is truffle" [sic]) while also seeking to do some medical self-help ("what is piles"). The squeeze on UK living standards is also apparent from the food searches which this year are headed by Asda recipes Tesco Sainsburys and pizza. Close behind those budget-conscious choices and pointing to even tighter times ahead are chicken chocolate Dominos (the pizza delivery company) Morrisons (supermarket chain) and Argos. Those compare with the same category for last year which Google's press release then showed as starting with Tesco and recipes and then Asda pizza wine Sainsburys Jamie Oliver Morrisons cakes and curry. Meanwhile the new "How to…" category indicates that the nation's youth increasingly turns to the internet for advice on key tasks some of which may be worrying in their naivete the searches in order try to find out how to revise snog reference (as in learned papers) wallpaper draw sleep flirt geek (which turns out to be instructions on computer maintenance) pronounce and shuffle.
