Googie is offering, for one month only, your chance to spin back to those halcyon days before stock markets crashed around everyone's ears, when lawsuits against people accused of peer-to-peer filesharing were plentiful, and there was more than one bank on the high street where you could put your savings. Yes, it's letting you spin the wheel of fortune, fame and chance back to 2001, when it had a measly 1.36bn pages to search from. (Now? Too many to count, apparently.) Why 2001? Why not 1998? Because, says the FAQ, "for various technical reasons that are too boring to go into, earlier versions of our index aren't readily accessible. But we did still want to offer users a chance to search an older index as a way of looking back at web history, and the January 2001 index is the best we can do. We hope you enjoy it." And so it goes... According to the Google blog,   hidden in a corner beneath Larry's and Sergey's original lab coats, we found a vintage search index in mint condition. We dusted it off and took it for a spin, gobsmacked to see how different the web was in early 2001. "iPod" did not refer to a music player, "youtube" was nonsense, and if you were looking for "Michael Phelps," chances are you meant the scientist, not the swimmer. "Wikipedia" was brand new. Remember "hanging chads"?   Or indeed, remember the hubris of this deal? Or the design horror of this page? Or this slowly sinking hulk? You can do the searching - set up in association with the Internet Archive - at Google's 2001 search. Basically, the way to do it is to do a search and choose "View this in the 2001 archive". We were already hard at work with the Guardian weblog, though the archive seems to think that the Onlineblog - which preceded this one - didn't start until 2002. (We beg to differ.) But that's the thing about the past - it's never the same as the last time you looked at it.
