In the dispute between the European Commission's competition group and Google, one issue has remained uppermost, and repeatedly reiterated: that Google should not distort competition by giving preferential treatment to its own "vertical search" businesses when people are looking for organic results. Here's an extract from a speech Joaquin Almunia, the EC's antitrust commissioner, gave in May:  First, in its general search results on the web, Google displays links to its own vertical search services. Vertical search services are specialised search engines which focus on specific topics, such as restaurants, news or products. Alongside its general search service, Google also operates several vertical search services of this kind in competition with other players. In its general search results, Google displays links to its own vertical search services differently than it does for links to competitors. We are concerned that this may result in preferential treatment compared to those of competing services, which may be hurt as a consequence.  This key problem boils down to one point. If you search on Google for "iPod" - an example the company itself offers in its proposed settlement – you see a sponsored (paid-for) link at the top of the page, followed by a subtly delineated box titled "Shop for iPod on Google" and "Sponsored" in small letters on the top right.

Photograph: Public domain Photograph: Public domain    That box is Google's "shopping vertical" – in essence, an online store. But why is it there? Typing the word "iPod" into Google isn't, of itself, an expressed intent to buy an iPod. In years gone by, Google would have offered up various "organic" search results for iPod – probably starting with Apple's, which in the modern day is pushed down the page by the box. The box is Google's "vertical search" shopping service. The question is, why is Google's one there? Is it the best shopping service out there? There's no evidence that it is; the links that appear there appear because they're paid for, not because Google has chosen them on any merit. (Danny Sullivan, who has covered the search business for years, calls this inclusion of paid links a "broken promise", observing that Google's founders said repeatedly that they wouldn't have such paid-for links, even in Google Shopping results.) Nor do they always seem to be the cheapest; a quick search on Foundem for "iPod" when this article was being written showed the lowest price being offered for an iPod Touch was £60, compared to £130 on the Google Shopping page. (Foundem, it should be noted, has formally complained to the EC that Google penalises competing services in its results.)     A search on Foundem for 'iPod' in November 2013 turns up similar results - but the cheapest on offer is significantly cheaper than that shown on Google's Shopping space with its paid-for links. So how can Google's rank higher? Photograph: /Public domain Photograph: Public domain    Can we be sure that Google Shopping is the best vertical search engine for shopping? How would we prove that either way? And if it isn't, why is it in the top, prominent position? In principle, the argument is the same as that deployed against Microsoft in the US and Europe in the 1990s and, after 2000, over Windows and Internet Explorer. Windows had (and still has) a monopoly of desktop operating systems – and the desktop was by far the dominant path to the internet. Microsoft then used that dominance to push Internet Explorer towards dominance by shutting out rivals, particularly Netscape. In the US the Department of Justice sued; in Europe, the EC's DG Comp group raised a "Statement of Objections", which eventually saw Microsoft sued for anti-competitive practices and forced to offer a "browser choice" system which offered users a variety of choices of browser. In Google's case, the elements are its dominance of "organic search" - when you use Google to search for something - and its apparent annexation of related topics. That is why "vertical search" – for things such as shopping – is important. It's a source of competition from which consumers can benefit through innovation by the providers. Those which can forge the best deals, or which have the most effective search strategies, will be able to attract consumers and succeed. But they won't if Google is able simply to put its own shopping site at the top of the page without having to compete fairly with rival shopping sites. And especially not if – as Foundem alleges – Google suppresses rival vertical search companies so that they never appear for the average search. Foundem's page doesn't appear in the first ten results pages for "iPod" on Google UK; the first vertical search company is GetPrice, an Australian company. Even a search using the words "buy iPod" on Google UK doesn't turn up Foundem's site in the first five results pages, which would see off around 99% of searchers. Moreover, there's no internal market in Google that forces the Shopping box to pay for the space it receives. And, equally, no rival can bid for – or buy – that space. In its most recent proposals to the EC – multiple copies of which have been leaked to the Guardian – Google offers to let rival vertical search services buy space in that box. It will have prime position, while the rivals will get small links. (The proposal is ringed in red.)

Their complaint is twofold. First: it does nothing about Google pushing down rival vertical search services in organic results - the point which Almunia has reiterated in his speeches. Almunia said in a speech to the LSE last week: "One of the competition concerns we have in this case is that Google may divert internet traffic through favourable treatment – within its web search results – to its own specialised web search services as compared to the links of competing services; such as those specialised in helping users find restaurants and shops." The second concern is that either way, Google wins. If shoppers click on the links in its part of the box, it gets paid; if they click on the links from rivals, it gets paid. And the system it is proposing (contained in the proposals) would maximise its revenue, because it will operate in the same way as its AdWords system: links are positioned through a combination of their likelihood of being clicked and the amount being offered for them. In other words, the maximum possible revenue. As part of its proposals – dressed as a concession – Google has offered rivals a new "reserve price" (the lowest amount they can bid for a space) of 3 euro cents. The problem with that is that it's an auction system – so any worthwhile link will attract far higher bids, and so more money for Google. The broader objection is that Google isn't meant to be benefiting from its monopoly in organic search in this way; that this hampers innovation. If the next space for innovation is in vertical search (which is possible, since "organic" search seems largely played out), or some other area altogether, then letting Google put its own products front and centre stymies that innovation. The frequent riposte is "well, it's Google's search pages – it should be allowed to do what it wants". It was Microsoft's operating system, too, and the US Department of Justice and the EC both (rightly) ruled that it couldn't do exactly what it wanted – the EC with rather more force than the US. The problem with letting Google do what it wants with its search page, according to its rivals, is that it is bad for competition in fields which have nothing to do with organic search (what might be called "search on its merits"). The problem isn't confined only to the desktop; mobile search is increasingly important, and so Google has offered similar proposals there, which have drawn much the same objections. On mobile, the proposals shove rivals off to the side, on a hyperlink.     Google's proposals for search on mobile: rival vertical search would be accessible only via a link, while its own offering would be plainly visible.

It doesn't matter whether you're searching for a camera or a hotel in Glasgow: Google's vertical search results come up top, and rivals' are nowhere. It's very surprising that no matter what the topic – cameras, consumer electronics, restaurants, hotels – that Google's vertical search should always somehow be better than any rival. Unless, that is, it is distorting the results in its favour. There are many more issues – hotels and restaurants have complained at being pushed down in organic search, while Google's paid-for "vertical search" becomes more and more prominent, and some publishers have complained about their inability to dictate how much of their content is displayed on Google News. But it's the rows about contention between vertical search providers which is the clearest illustration of the row over monopoly and its potential&nbsp;     Google proposal to EC for search results on the example of hotels in Glasgow, October 2013.

While Google hasn't been called to give any public testimony about its position in Europe, in the US the executive chairman Eric Schmidt was called before the US Senate Antitrust Committee to testify about this in November 2011. Some of the search results have been tweaked since – with Google's vertical search becoming more prominent – but it's the tenor of Schmidt's arguments which are key. The video is edited by Foundem to respond to Schmidt's points, but it has not altered the timeline of his responses. Google has given no public explanation in Europe of its use of "Universal Search", which is part of the complaint made by the EC against Google - but the complaint in the US was the same.         Foundem's analysis of Eric Schmidt's testimony in 2011 to the US Senate antitrust committee.    What are the solutions, then? Google objects that it doesn't want to make its algorithm open, because that would lead to abuse. But all that sites such as Foundem say they want is for Google to subject its vertical offerings to the same ranking system as everyone else. Foundem did a thorough examination of this possibility&nbsp;in November 2011, after Schmidt's testimoney. The video above includes passages about the strange way that Google's services always rank higher than rivals. And what of Google Shopping? It is, said Schmidt, "a type of thematic search that allows consumers to compare prices and see which websites are selling a particular product". But is it the best&nbsp;"thematic search" product for doing that? Even though Google is big, it seems unlikely. And that's the crux of the dispute. The question now is whether Google will shift – or whether the EC thinks that the search company has done enough to satisfy it. • Read:&nbsp;Google's vertical search proposals: what will be EC antitrust chief's verdict? • This article was amended on 17 December 2013 to note the fact that Foundem has made a formal complaint against Google to the European Commission.
