A search engine that knows exactly what you are looking for, that can understand the question you are asking even better than you do, and find exactly the right information for you, instantly - that was the future predicted by Google yesterday. Speaking at a conference for Google's European partners, entitled Zeitgeist '06, on the outskirts of London last night Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and co-founder Larry Page gave an insight into perhaps the most ambitious project the Californian business is undertaking - artificial intelligence (AI). "The ultimate search engine would understand everything in the world. It would understand everything that you asked it, and give you back the exact right thing instantly," he told an audience representing firms from Warner Music and AOL, to BSkyB and the BBC. He said one thing that he had learned since Google launched eight years ago was that technology could change faster than expected, and that AI could be a reality within a few years. Google's executives were also forced to defend their tactics. While suggesting the business could one day capture a 20% share of the $800bn global advertising market, Mr Schmidt explained that the apparently scatter-gun approach to research which lets engineers spend a fifth of their time working on pet projects, also allows the company to innovate faster than rivals. While this has created some products (such as shopping service Froogle) that have not been a great success, it also led to the Gmail service which is catching up with market leaders such as Hotmail. But the lack of a visible pipeline of development from Google infuriates some of its stockholders, who would rather it concentrated on a few lucrative services. "We are very clear, and I want to be clear and on the record," said Mr Schmidt. "We run the company for the benefit of our end-users globally." Looking at the current court case in Houston where Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, former executives of collapsed energy giant Enron, await the outcome of their trial for fraud, he added: "Speaking as an American company chief executive, when the management team starts focusing on the stock price rather than focusing on its business and customers, you get a really bad outcome. We are focused on doing the right thing for the long-term." Mr Schmidt also attacked suggestions by US cable firms that providers of capacity-hungry internet services - such as video and TV - should be charged to run their services over the web. This presents a challenge to what is generally seen as the internet's neutrality, that everyone should be able to get on to it. "We believe this violates one of the founding principles that built the internet today," and it could stifle the next wave of innovation, he said. theguardian.com/technology â‰¥
