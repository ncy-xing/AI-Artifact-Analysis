Google has dumped its small stake in rival Chinese internet search group Baidu.com as it looks to grow its own business in the country. Google bought a 2% stake in June 2004 for $5m (£2.7m) and Baidu.com floated on Nasdaq the following August. Google sold the stake earlier this week, according to a US regulatory filing. At the time of the sale its 749,625 shares were worth $63m. Baidu is China's leading search engine and when Google originally made its investment it was seen as a possible buyer of the company. Since then, however, Google has controversially established its own base in China, although it has been forced to censor its search results.
