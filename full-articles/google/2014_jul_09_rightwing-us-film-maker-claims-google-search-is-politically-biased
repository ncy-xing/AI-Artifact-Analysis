Prominent rightwing film-maker and author Dinesh D'Souza has claimed that politically-motivated bias is the reason behind the ongoing problem with Google's search engine over listings of his new film. Users have claimed that Google is confusing America the D'Souza film currently on release with 2016 Obama's America D'Souza's anti-Obama polemic that was a modest hit in 2012 taking $33m at the US box office. After lawyers sent Google a letter on Monday claiming that the company was "misdirecting many users who mistakenly believed the film was not playing in theaters" Google responded by stating "Our systems have unfortunately confused the title of the movie 'America' because it's a common term and appears in many movie titles." However D'Souza himself has now complained that Google may not be entirely neutral. Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter he said "The American people need to know if Google is going to be a trustworthy source of news and information that doesn't tilt in one political direction or another." D'Souza has also claimed that hypermarket chain Costco have "banned" America Imagine a World without Her the book the film is based on also for political reasons. "Costco is free to ban my book but their customers are also free to shop at other stores that don't censor books. It's one thing for Costco executives to pal around with President Barack Obama and donate almost exclusively to Democrats but to turn their company into a tool for suppressing dissent against the government is another matter."  America was released on 27 June and has taken $4.4m at the US box office so far.
