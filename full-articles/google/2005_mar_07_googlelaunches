"Google is set to launch on Monday an updated version of its desktop search tool whose enhancements include the ability to search the full text of Adobe Systems PDF files and the metadata of multimedia files a Google executive said. "Until now the product could only index the names of PDF and multimedia files such as image music and video files. But the new version improves on this by indexing the entire content of PDF files and the metadata of multimedia files such as song and artist names in music files said Nikhil Bhatla a Google product manager."
