Google has recently been experimenting with different home pages and now it has plumped for something dramatically different. You didn't notice The headings that used to be tabs -- Web Images News etc -- have become simple text links and have now moved to the top left of the home page. This is consistent with other Google properties such as Gmail and leaves the front page looking even cleaner than before. However there are now so many Google products most of them are on a drop-down list. Unfortunately. Google has also "announced its critical first steps toward a universal search model that will offer users a more integrated and comprehensive way to search for and view information online." It says   Google's vision for universal search is to ultimately search across all its content sources compare and rank all the information in real time and deliver a single integrated set of search results that offers users precisely what they are looking for. Beginning today the company will incorporate information from a variety of previously separate sources - including videos images news maps books and websites - into a single set of results. At first universal search results may be subtle. Over time users will recognize additional types of content integrated into their search results as the company advances toward delivering a truly comprehensive search experience.   Google is also experimenting with ways to display searches at Google Experimental. It's trying timeline- and map-based views and left-hand/right-hand navigations. For example try this. Google has provided some background to its thinking in Behind the scenes with universal search. Also at Search Engine Land Danny Sullivan provides a detailed overview in Google 2.0 Google Universal Search.
