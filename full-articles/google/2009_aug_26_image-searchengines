There's huge untapped potential in the image search sector according to the business-to-business service Imprezzeo. Backed by Independent News &amp; Media. Imprezzeo is initially targeting news agencies photo-sharing sites and commercial photo libraries but thinks the bigger potential could include retail social media and even dating sites - all of whom would benefit from searching by image rather than text says chief executive Dermot Corrigan. Set up in October 2007 and launched in beta one year later Imprezzeo employs seven staff in London and at its development base in Sydney Australia.
