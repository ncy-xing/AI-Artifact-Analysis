A "survey released Tuesday by San Mateo, Calif.-based market research firm Vividence found that Google's results vary little from those found on other search sites. In addition, despite the search king's continued success in attracting customers, its users are less likely to click on advertisements listed on its site," reports CNet. "To gather their results, researchers at Vividence surveyed and monitored 2,000 individuals as they interacted with search engine sites, including Google, Ask Jeeves, Lycos, Microsoft's MSN and Yahoo. The company found that Google clearly remains consumers' favorite, largely because of the search engine's less-cluttered interface. In fact, Vividence said almost 90 percent of Google users reported having a 'strongly positive experience,' while only 68 percent of users said the same of Yahoo, 50 percent for Ask Jeeves, 48 percent for Lycos and 41 percent for MSN."
