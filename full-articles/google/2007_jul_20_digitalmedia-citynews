ITV is understood to be on the brink of signing a deal with Google to provide search services across its newly relaunched ITV.com website. The deal, which would see Google replace existing search provider Yahoo!, is earmarked to start when the rollout of the new website is completed - tentatively predicted to be at the end of the month. Monetising the website beyond display and sponsorship advertising will be vital to ITV when it completes the £20m relaunch of ITV.com. The deal could also open the door for a wide-ranging partnership including using Google Video or YouTube as a "shop front" for clips of ITV shows along the lines of a deal struck by the BBC in March. In December last year, Google struck a deal with Sky to provide search, email and other services, including a video-sharing website called SkyCast. Google, which also has a three-year, $900m (£450m) search and advertising deal with MySpace.com, splits search revenues with Sky and has an agreement to investigate future forms of web, TV and mobile advertising. ITV is in the midst of the staged rollout of content and services on the website. While simulcasts of channels ITV1, ITV2 and ITV3 are already available, a staged rollout of ITV.com's video streaming will see the 30-day catch-up service and programme archive activated for different programme genres on a week-by-week basis. Soaps such as Coronation Street and Emmerdale were the first to launch, followed by broadband games, drama, lifestyle, sport, entertainment and news.
