More than 1400 Google employees signed an internal petition criticizing the lack of transparency around the project and at least one employee resigned in protest. But Tuesday's letter which was initially signed by nine current Google employees is a bold step for employees of a company that prizes internal transparency but considers leaking information to be not Googley. Organizers of the letter said they would continuously update the letter as more employees signed on; by midday there were more than 50 signers.

Project Dragonfly has been roundly criticized by human rights organizations a group of which warned that by accommodating the Chinese authorities’ repression of dissent Google would be actively participating in human rights violations. The project would reportedly allow a Chinese company that partnered with Google to access users’ search history by querying their phone numbers. Giving the Chinese government ready access to user data as required by Chinese law would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses the Google employees wrote in their letter. Dragonfly would also enable censorship and government-directed disinformation and destabilize the ground truth on which popular deliberation and dissent rely … We refuse to build technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable wherever they may be. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The latest employee protest comes amid a growing labor movement of technology workers one that has focused not just on working conditions but also on ethical considerations related to the work itself. In recent months employees at companies including Microsoft Amazon and Salesforce have spoken out internally about their employers’ work for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the United States amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration.
