Sometimes Google is just a bit too good at carrying out its stated goal to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Take search suggestions the helpful feature that sees Google autocomplete phrases typed into its search engine. Type How can I cook macaroni ... and the site will add cheese on to the end saving you six whole keystrokes. Wonderful But it turns out there could be some less desirable implementations of the technology. The search-suggestion feature and a similar feature that offers related searches at the bottom of the results page could be helping to compromise the right to anonymity of complainants in UK rape and sexual assault cases. Type in the defendant's name with a little extra information and the search engine may suggest related searches that include the victim's name. It's not the first time that Google or one of its competitors in big tech has been caught out after handing control to AI-driven crowdsourced suggestions.
