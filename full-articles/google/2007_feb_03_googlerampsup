All you slackers out there have not been using Google's personalised search service but if you are using a Google account such as Gmail then Google has probably turned it on. It's now the default. If you don't want your search history logged and fed back to you you can turn it off. (Google will still keep logging your searches of course but says it will only keep aggregated information.) The change was announced on the Google Blog and Search Engine Land has a detailed run-down of the service. The great gaping hole in the personalised search system is there is no facility to remove sites. I'd happily take the time to tick a few boxes if it ensured I'd never again get results from sites like shopping.msn.com uk.shopping.com dealtime nextag shopgenie pricerunner pricegrabbler etc and any URL with ciao in it. Having just run a few tests I do think Google has got better at handling this sort of stuff and product searches are less spammy than they used to be. Well done Google But if clicking things makes them more important to me why can't I anti-click things to make them less important
