"The new Google service available starting Wednesday on Google Labs tracks every search users have done when they are signed on to My Search History and it also lets them search all the pages they've found using Google.com's search engine" reports Reuters. "Users will be able to review the full text of any Web page they clicked on from a Google search results page. They also have the option to disable the service or remove particular searches from their history. "All of the information will be stored on Google's servers — something analysts said is all but certain to rankle privacy advocates — which will allow users to view their search history regardless of where they are when they sign on."
