Let's start with a declaration of interest: Google are not a client of mine – and they aren't paying me to say this. In fact, I have worked for nearly all their rivals and competitors over the years. But nonetheless: I love Google. Why is that? Because I know they are so much more than a search box. Your average person on the street thinks of Google as synonymous with search. Some may have noticed that they also have a browser (Chrome), that they own YouTube, Gmail and Google+. If they read Wired or similar, they may also have heard of Google Glass, or Ingress, their virtual reality game.  Basically, in the public mind Google equals the internet. That certainly seems to be the conclusion of the Meaningful Brands analysis I saw Havas Media present at the Guardian Activate conference: "Google scores are outstanding on improving our wellbeing with its positive impact on our organisational skills, our intellect, our finances and our social and emotional wellbeing. However, these high scores drop (to number 61 in the UK) when we look at its impact on our community, the economy, environment, governance and ethics." Here's the actual data that Havas Media showed at the conference for all tech brands, showing Google as a leading example of a general malaise with the IT sector:     Havas Meaningful Brands data 1 Photograph: Havas Photograph: Havas         Havas Meaningful Brands data 2 Photograph: Havas Photograph: Havas         Havas Meaningful Brands data 3 Photograph: Havas Photograph: Havas    If we were looking at that data and talking about Paypal I'd say fair enough. Google is the 'hoover' of internet searches, so it's natural to think of it as personally useful. But it's not the Google I know and love. It's not the Google that has committed a billion US dollars to renewable energy projects, and which made one of the more inspiring contributions to the wave of "eco-corporobabble" with its RE&lt;C (renewable energy cheaper than coal) challenge. It's not the Google whose Impact Awards hand out big bursaries and vital exposure to really worthwhile projects like GiveDirectly and Charity:Water. It's not the Google whose Campus in London hosts 100 startups on any given day and over 60,000 visitors for their amazing programme of events. It's not the Google who gives any of their employees 20% of their time to spend on pet projects. And it's not the Google who constantly pops up in my research into smart cities, the eco benefits of cloud computing, employee green schemes and so on –&nbsp;as a real leader in developing tomorrow's society, economy and sustainability. No they aren't perfect. Some (like Julian Assange from Wikileaks) see Google as an example of a US State Department/Silicon Valley axis of evil. Part of the new cohort of American State hegemony. Others also point the finger, be it for antitrust, tax avoidance, censoring in China or (more on this later) snooping for the NSA. Google have taken a particular bashing in the UK, where the tabloids have gone after stories like burglars using Google Streetview, or the Google chief comms person being married to a Cameron aide, as if Google were some kind of evil corporation. Whatever element of truth there is to those stories, it does seem as if being a 'large American corporation' creates an attractive target in itself.
