Our favourite search engine, Google, came up with the goods again yesterday. It made available 20 years of Usenet discussions, stretching back to May 1981. Best of all, they've even provided a helpful timeline to some of the most significant postings. All certainly one in the eye for the doom merchants who said Google had ruined the Usenet archive it bought from the now dead deja.com. This is much better than anything that's come before.
