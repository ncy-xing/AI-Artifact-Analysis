Nick Cave has dissected a song produced by the viral chatbot software ChatGPT written in the style of Nick Cave calling it bullshit and a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human. Writing in his newsletter the Red Hand Files on Monday Cave responded to a fan called Mark in New Zealand who had sent him a song written by ChatGPT. The artificial intelligence which can be directed to impersonate the style of specific individuals was used by Mark to create a song in the style of Nick Cave. Filled with dark biblical imagery ChatGPT's song included the chorus I am the sinner I am the saint / I am the darkness I am the light / I am the hunter I am the prey / I am the devil I am the savior.

Suffice to say I do not feel the same enthusiasm around this technology he wrote. I understand that ChatGPT is in its infancy but perhaps that is the emerging horror of AI that it will forever be in its infancy as it will always have further to go and the direction is always forward always faster. It can never be rolled back or slowed down as it moves us toward a utopian future maybe or our total destruction. Who can possibly say which Judging by this song in the style of Nick Cave’ though it doesn't look good Mark. The apocalypse is well on its way. This song sucks. He called ChatGPT an exercise in replication as travesty. Writing a good song is not mimicry or replication or pastiche it is the opposite he wrote. It is an act of self-murder that destroys all one has strived to produce in the past. It is those dangerous heart-stopping departures that catapult the artist beyond the limits of what he or she recognises as their known self. This is part of the authentic creative struggle that precedes the invention of a unique lyric of actual value; it is the breathless confrontation with one's vulnerability one's perilousness one's smallness pitted against a sense of sudden shocking discovery; it is the redemptive artistic act that stirs the heart of the listener where the listener recognizes in the inner workings of the song their own blood their own struggle their own suffering.

He thanked Mark but said With all the love and respect in the world this song is bullshit a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human and well I don't much like it.
