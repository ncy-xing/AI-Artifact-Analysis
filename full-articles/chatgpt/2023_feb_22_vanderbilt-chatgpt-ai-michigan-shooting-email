Officials at Vanderbilt University apologized for using an AI chatbot to write a consoling email to students after a mass shooting at Michigan State University.   Related Michigan professor calls for tighter gun control after students fatally shot    The message went out last week from the office of equity diversity and inclusion at the Peabody College of Education and Human Development reported the Vanderbilt Hustler the student newspaper. The message said the Michigan shooting in which three students were killed was a reminder of the importance of creating an inclusive environment. One of the key ways to promote a culture of care on our campus is through building strong relationships with one another the brief message said. This involves actively engaging with people from different backgrounds and perspectives listening to their stories and showing empathy and support. At the bottom of the message in small print the email said Paraphrase from OpenAI's ChatGPT AI language model personal communication. The mail was signed by two administrators. Nicole Joseph one of the associate deans who signed the letter sent out a follow-up message apologizing and saying using ChatGPT to write the message was poor judgment the Hustler said. While we believe in the message of inclusivity expressed in the email using ChatGPT to generate communications on behalf of our community in a time of sorrow and in response to a tragedy contradicts the values that characterize Peabody College Joseph's message said. As with all new technologies that affect higher education this moment gives us all an opportunity to reflect on what we know and what we still must learn about AI. Joseph and the assistant dean Hasina Mohyuddin who also signed the initial email are stepping back from their roles with the equity diversity and inclusion office while the university investigates ABC News reported. Laith Kayat a Vanderbilt student from Michigan whose sibling attends Michigan State told the Hustler the use of AI was disgusting. Deans provosts and the chancellor do more. Do anything. And lead us into a better future with genuine human empathy not a robot Kayat said.
