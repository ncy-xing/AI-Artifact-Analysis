"The growth rate in the mobile search usage has been impressive - in the third quarter of 2010 we saw 130% growth, for example. According to internal statistics, mobile search usage has doubled in 2010. Search traffic on Android tripled in the first half of 2010. "By next year, five billion mobile phones will be in service, out of a total world population of about seven billion. By 2014, there will be more mobile internet users than desktop internet users. • What was your best and worst moment?"Highlights were Google's announcement that mobile advertising is now responsible for $1bn of annual revenue - demonstrating that it's now a very significant opportunity and can connect consumers with businesses wherever they are.  "We hired even more engineers in the mobile team in London this year. The entire team is very excited. Voice Search is now available in more than 15 languages around the world - and on Android devices we see 25% of search queries coming from voice - it's great to see millions of people using this new technology to make their lives easier." "Lowlights were finding the first scratch on my iPad screen - very annoying." • What's your hot tip for 2011? "Tablets, and an increasing diversity of mobile handsets will demonstrate that there's room for a wide range of form factors. We've added NFC support to Android, and it will be exciting to see how developers incorporate it into their applications. So far NFC hasn't had huge take-up outside Japan or a few specific applications such as the Oyster Card but there are some big opportunities out there."
