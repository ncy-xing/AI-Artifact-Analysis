 "Google on Thursday unveiled its long-anticipated desktop application for searching through files, e-mail messages, and Web histories on the local PC, beating competitors like Microsoft and Yahoo to the punch," reports TechWeb. "Google Desktop Search, which can be downloaded free of charge from the Mountain View, Calif.-based company's Labs site, lets users retrieve e-mail from Outlook and Outlook Express, documents from Microsoft Office apps, chat sessions from AOL Instant Messenger, and Web pages viewed with Internet Explorer." Later, it says: "Google's desktop search is integrated with the familiar Web search, with a new Desktop tab appearing at Google.com, and results culled from a search of the local drive added to the top of any search through the Web. The local results are displayed at the top of the list, marked with a new logo, and tagged with the phrase, 'stored on your computer.' "One of its key features, said Price, is its ability to search through previously-viewed Web pages. Google Desktop Search searches through Internet Explorer's History file, and displays matches, including thumbnails of the relevant page in many cases." Comment: Google Desktop Search only works with Windows XP and Windows 2000 and Internet Explorer. It indexes the full text of Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, and files in TXT, HTML, DOC, XLS, and PPT formats (Office 2000+). There's a FAQ.
