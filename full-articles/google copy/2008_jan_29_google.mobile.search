Internet giant Google is relaunching its mobile search engine in the company's latest attempt to break into the lucrative mobile phone market. The American dotcom hopes that its new system will get more people using their phone to search for local data, maps and news. In an attempt to draw more customers, the interface has been made cleaner and faster, and the results are being tailored for mobile as opposed to computer users. "It's the same search index but it's a little more aggressive on location," said Dave Burke, engineering manager with Google mobile in London. "Let's say for instance you put 'Arsenal' in there – chances are you're not going to look up the history of the club but you're looking for the latest scores. So we have lots of sports information that we fire at you." The service, which is already available in the US, was launched quietly last week. From tomorrow, however, all traffic to Google from mobile phones in Britain, Canada, France and Germany will be directed to the new pages. Growth area The Silicon Valley company is targeting the mobile industry as a huge potential growth area, and has phone engineering groups based in Waterloo, Canada, and at the company's Mountain View HQ in California, as well as a rapidly expanding 80-strong team of engineers in London.  Among its projects is Android, a new open source phone operating system which it hopes will be adopted by manufacturers and can challenge existing software such as Symbian, used by Nokia, and Microsoft's Windows Mobile. The market certainly has massive potential: Google estimates that there are 2 billion mobile handsets with some sort of data access, and research company D2 Mobile suggests that the worldwide mobile advertising spend could rise from £500m to more than £4bn by 2012. Burke added that Google was "looking at all options" in its quest to deliver better quality search results based on the location of the user. Wi-Fi hot spots Apple recently announced that it was combining Google's existing triangulation system – which calculates an individual's location using mobile phone masts - with a method using Wi-Fi hot spots instead of masts, created by Boston-based Skyhook Wireless.  Burke would not comment on whether Google would work directly with Skyhook or come up with its own alternative, but he did say that collecting such information was "a lot easier than collecting street view data" – the images that Google uses to show street surfers pictures of major American cities. "If you're going to concentrate on location you want every bit of data you can," he told the Guardian.  "Cell ID is one location, the address of your Wi-Fi access point is another. The end result is that we want the user to have the best possible experience, and we'll do whatever it takes to get it … to us they're just network signals and we're interested in all of them." Although so-called location-based services have long been the holy grail for the mobile industry, many companies are looking at alternative ways to deliver such information thanks to the slow uptake of handsets capable of satellite navigation.
