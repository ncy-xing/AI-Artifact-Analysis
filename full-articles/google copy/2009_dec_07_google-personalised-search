Google is extending its personalised search. From now on, all users will find their search results customised. Google stores up to 180 days of signed-out search activity in the user's cookie. It stores searches users have done before and results they have clicked so that if they favour a certain news site Google will feature that site higher when it delivers the results. "Now when you search using Google, we will be able to better provide you with the most relevant results possible", software engineer Bryan Horling and product manager Matthew Kulick wrote in a blogpost announcing the change.             Before only users who were signed in and had enabled their web history on their Google account found their search results customised.  Now this service has been expanded to all users; they can opt out by deleting Google's cookies in the browser or click "Web History" in the top right corner of the search result page and then "Disable customisations". So users can turn personalisation off â€“ but since it's switched on by default most users will leave it that way, and privacy advocates will very alarmed by the fact that it is an opt-out and not an opt-in service.  Google says the aim of the move is to provide better search results to its customers. Another reason is that by building a better profile of users' web activity it can target ads more precisely. But most of all, it will make the life of those involved in search engine optimisation harder as search results will vary from user to user. From now on, convincing Google algorithms to push a particular site to the top of the search results will be all the more difficult.
