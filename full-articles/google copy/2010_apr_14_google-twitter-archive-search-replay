I'm hoping @jackschofield didn't tweet anything regrettable because Google is now bringing old and long-forgotten tweets to light. The Official Google Blog says:  "Starting today, you can zoom to any point in time and 'replay' what people were saying publicly about a topic on Twitter. To try it out, click 'Show options' on the search results page, then select 'Updates'. The first page will show you the familiar latest and greatest short-form updates from a comprehensive set of sources, but now there's a new chart at the top. In that chart, you can select the year, month or day, or click any point to view the tweets from that specific time period."  Not being on Twitter does not mean you have nothing to worry about. Google is also searching MySpace, Facebook, FriendFeed and Buzz.
