Hand sanitiser topped three separate search categories in Australia during a year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, Google has revealed, and “US election” was the leading overall search term. “Where can I buy toilet paper?” was the most searched for “can I” phrase followed by “Where can I buy hand sanitiser?” People keen to make their own hand sanitiser when there was a shortage earlier in the year resulted in it topping three separate lists: “how to …” make it; “recipe” for it and “DIY” hand sanitiser. “DIY ventilator” was fourth on the DIY category with “face mask pattern” and “neck hammock” second and third respectively. Google reported that “coronavirus” was the second most-searched term overall and among news topics by Australians in 2020 behind “US election” in both categories. Other leading overall search terms related to the pandemic included “Zoom” at No 4, “coronavirus symptoms” (No 5) and “coronavirus Victoria” (No 9).

Toilet paper came in fifth as it became the panic-buy item of choice when lockdowns first kicked in in March, forcing supermarkets to impose temporary buying limits. “Can I leave Australia?” ranked No 10 in the “can I” searches. The Australian government introduced a travel ban for citizens and permanent residents at the beginning of the pandemic and closed the borders to most international arrivals. People searching the definition of words Googled “Covid” (No 1) and “pandemic” (No 2) along with “barre” (No 8) after the prime minister struggled earlier in the year to explain the rules concerning exercise during lockdown. “Lockdown” was the ninth most searched for word in the definitions list while “stimulus package” ranked No 4. As everyone was cooking more during lockdown, sourdough recipes and how to make bread were also leading search results. As many businesses were closed during lockdown, searches for Centrelink or how to apply for jobkeeper also ranked highly. Before the pandemic, Australia was being ravaged by fires, and the Fires Near Me app in New South Wales became indispensable, so it was no surprise “fires near me” was No 3 in news topics and eighth in overall searches. A week after a senior constable was charged over leaking custody photos of former AFL player and coach Dani Laidley in May, Google on Wednesday said Laidley was the most searched for Australian public figure in 2020, followed by comedian Celeste Barber, who raised millions for bushfire relief, and then NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. George Pell and Quaden Bayles, the nine-year-old boy who won an apology from Miranda Devine, rounded out the top five. The top global figure searched for by Australians was US president-elect Joe Biden, with Donald Trump No 8, behind others including Kim Jong-un, Boris Johnson, Kamala Harris and Joe Exotic from Netflix’s Tiger King documentary. NBA was the most searched for sport in Australia, ranking No 3 in overall searches behind “US election” and “coronavirus”. Basketball star Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash, ranked No 1 in Google’s “loss” category of searches ahead of Naya Rivera and Chadwick Boseman.
