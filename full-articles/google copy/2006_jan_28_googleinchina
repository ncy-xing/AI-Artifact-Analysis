The Official Google Blog has posted a defence of its actions, Google in China. Over at Search Engine Watch Blog, Gary Price has posted a round-up of coverage including remarks made by Sergey Brin to CNN, and articles that look at what's being censored. Google Blogoscoped has also covered the ground, picking up Gary's observation, Google Removes Its Help Entry on Censorship. It also links to a Joy of Tech cartoon. Finally, in An Open Letter to Google, Andrew Shieh compares searches for "Falun Gong" on Google.com (1,840,000 results) with a search on Google.cn (11,900). He writes:   The results on Google.com show generally accurate articles about Falun Gong. The results on the Google.cn site are all government propaganda. It's an embarrassment. No one at Google can possibly be proud of the search results shown above. This is not the same as displaying incomplete search results; this is showing misinformation, lies, and propaganda. When you remove all of the sites that speak the truth, all you are left with is lies.   Note: I redid the searches to include quotation marks.
