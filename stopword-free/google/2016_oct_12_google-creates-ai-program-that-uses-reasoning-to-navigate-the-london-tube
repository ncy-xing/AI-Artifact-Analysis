Google scientists created computer program uses basic reasoning learn navigate London Underground The Artificial Intelligence AI agent answer questions content snippets stories work family relationships looking family tree Scientists predict future similar approach pave way virtual assistants able instantaneously scour internet answer questions carry instructions precision Herbert Jaegar computer scientist University Bremen said I think described rational reasoning They tasks involve planning structuring information chunks re-combining them. Although tasks fairly simple basic smartphone app navigate tube map way program achieved results seen impressive It programs combine external memory approach called deep-learning program learns tasks independently pre-programmed set rules human Prof Geoff Hinton British scientist regarded father deep learning said door open deep learning applied complex tasks originally thought possible Until recently far obvious deep learning used allow acquire algorithms needed conscious deliberate reasoning said Hinton works University Toronto Google Deep learning recently stormed ahead computing strategies tasks like language translation image speech recognition enabled computer beat top-ranked player Lee Sedol Go However technique generally performed poorly task overarching strategy needed navigation extracting actual meaning text The latest program achieved adding external memory designed temporarily store important pieces information fish needed The human equivalent working memory short-term repository brain allows stay task doing involves steps like following recipe Alex Graves research scientist Google DeepMind London led work said work marked incremental step smart machines sudden departure I wary saying machine reason said We improved memory different kind memory believe necessary component reasoning It hard draw line sand. In study published journal Nature program able quickest route underground stops work end travelled say stops north Victoria station It given story snippets John playground John picked football. followed question Where football able answer correctly hinting future assistants Apple Siri replaced sophisticated Graves said story tasks look trivial human don like questions existing computer programs really badly The program developed got questions like right time Jaegar said latest effort DeepMind viewed just hop forward described stampede rapidly unfolding developments AI adding abilities computers necessarily restricted logical tasks navigation future Why inherent limit Everything brain possible physical said They computers come closer performance better things It matter time funding willing spend necessary millions develop things. A number high profile scientists warned existential threat posed AI Stephen Hawking cautioning humans develop artificial intelligence redesign ever-increasing rate But Demis Hassabis founder DeepMind previously played concerns We decades away sort technology need worry Hassabis said year
