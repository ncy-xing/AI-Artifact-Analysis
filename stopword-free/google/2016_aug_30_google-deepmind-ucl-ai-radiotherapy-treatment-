Google DeepMindhas announced working project improve treatment head neck cancers major collaboration NHS The London-based AI research arm online search firm partnering University College London Hospital attempt improve scans available radiotherapists using machine learning The project use anonymised scans 700 patients Radiotherapy works bombarding cancerous cells radiation kill minimising damage healthy cells Clinicians target treatment process called segmentation literally drawing different parts patient anatomy scans letting radiotherapy machines know tissue target tissue leave The process particularly painstaking slow head neck cancers taking hours clinician time DeepMind believes machine-learning techniques reduce time hour Our collaboration carefully analyse anonymised scans 700 patients UCLH company said blogpost determine potential machine learning make radiotherapy planning efficient Clinicians remain responsible deciding radiotherapy treatment plans hoped segmentation process reduced hours hour. Dr Yen-Ching Chang clinical lead radiotherapy UCLH said Developing machine learning automatically differentiate cancerous healthy tissue radiotherapy scans assist clinicians planning radiotherapy treatment This potential free clinicians spend time patient care education research benefit patients populations serve. The DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman led company health efforts added This real-world application artificial intelligence AI technology exactly set DeepMind We incredibly excited working radiotherapy team UCLH explore AI help reduce time takes plan radiotherapy treatment head neck cancer patients We hope work lead real benefits cancer patients country clinicians treat them. The collaboration comes February announcement DeepMind working Royal Free hospital monitor patients kidney functions help catch treat acute kidney failure inpatients July announcement research project conjunction Moorfields Eye Hospital examine possibility using machine learning identify eye conditions retinal scans As NHS collaborations project raise questions DeepMind data sharing agreements health service DeepMind said As work NHS treat patient data using project utmost care respect All scans anonymised line UCLH Information Governance policy shared DeepMind. UCLH added information FAQ published project UCLH rigorously ensure personally identifiable data included database scans provided DeepMind Health project During course project DeepMind Health rigorous measures protect security data disclose researchers engineers working project Data contributing study used research explores use machine learning identify differentiate healthy cancerous cells radiotherapy images. DeepMind Health securely destroy copies anonymised data received agreement hospital added
