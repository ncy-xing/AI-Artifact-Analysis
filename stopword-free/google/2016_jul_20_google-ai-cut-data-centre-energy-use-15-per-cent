Google says cut vast data centres energy use applying artificial intelligence manage efficiently humans The servers power billions web searches streamed films social media accounts estimated account approximately global greenhouse gas emissions Google believed biggest fleets world On Wednesday Google said proved cut total energy use data centres deploying machine learning DeepMind British AI company bought Â£400m Such centres require significant energy cooling constant adjustments air temperature pressure humidity run efficiently possible Mustafa Suleyman DeepMind co-founder said level complexity number variables meant job managing data centres algorithm outperform human He said It perfect examples setting humans really good intuition ve developed time machine-learning algorithm data describes real-world conditions years case It human able experience able learn sorts niche little edge cases seen data human wouldn able identify So able tune settings subtly accurately. Related Data centre emissions rival air travel digital demand soars Suleyman said reduction energy use achieved combination DeepMind accurately predicting incoming computational load people likely request data-hungry YouTube videos match prediction quickly cooling load required It tweaking knobs simultaneously said The environmental impact online world come increasing scrutiny recent years data centres share global emissions risen par aviation Google disclosed carbon footprint roughly equivalent Laos annual emissions says data centres improved 3.5 times computing power energy The trial using machine learning cut data centres energy carbon emissions began years ago tested servers Suleyman said It used double-digit percentage Google data centres globally applied end year Google disclose exactly energy data centres use says company responsible 0.01 global electricity use data centres DeepMind cut Google energy use cooling total energy use I really think just beginning There lots opportunities efficiencies data centre infrastructure said Suleyman One exciting things kind algorithms develop inherently general means machine-learning able perform wide variety environments power generation facilities energy networks Google data centres North South America Europe Asia Sophia Flucker director Operational Intelligence UK-based consultancy helps data centres cut energy use said feasible Google achieved big reduction I ve worked award-winning data centres plenty room improvement said
