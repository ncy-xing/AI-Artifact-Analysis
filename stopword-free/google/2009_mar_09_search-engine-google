A British physicist revealed plan launch new internet search engine powerful expert suggested important Google London-born scientist Stephen Wolfram says company Wolfram Research preparing unveil months ' time Known Wolfram Alpha site attempt address deficiencies current web search understanding people 's questions answering directly Fifty years ago computers young people assumed 'd quickly able handle kinds things able ask computer factual question compute answer wrote Wolfram Research website But n't work way I 'd thought eventually possible And years ago I realised I finally position try According creator understands questions users input calculates answers based extensive mathematical scientific engine Natural language processing ability determine long holy grail computer scientists believe interacting machines instinctive way And says Wolfram code Alpha cracked The way humans normally communicate natural language 's dealing spectrum knowledge I think 's realistic option communicating computers wrote Of course getting computers deal natural language turned incredibly difficult And example 're far away having computers systematically understand large volumes natural language text web Other search engines Google compare search terms billions documents stored servers pointing pages correct answer probably kept Although method proved phenomenally successful computer scientists continued trying create understand human language One recent claim breakthrough Powerset raised 12.5m Â£8.9m funding development years released limited search engine Wikipedia bought Microsoft 100m year According Nova Spivack founder intelligent web service Twine Alpha far impressive gone Wolfram Alpha like plugging vast electronic brain wrote It provides extremely impressive thorough questions asked different ways computes answers n't merely look big database The plan gaining media attention 49-year-old used getting noticed exploits After studying Eton Oxford Wolfram went receive PhD theoretical physics California Institute Technology age As result awarded Macarthur genius grant 1981 later generated mixture applause opprobrium famous book A New Kind Science In suggested simple algorithms complex rules structures root science Reaction idea Wolfram said boil computer program consisting just lines code mixed Some critics felt Wolfram unfairly refused submit theories peer review decade worked book claimed courted publicity building image reclusive genius Whatever outcome Wolfram 's audacious claims track record strong One previous creations computer program Mathematica used scientists help work
