Weather forecasts notoriously bad predicting chances impending rain drenched leaving house umbrella testify Now scientists Google DeepMind developed artificial intelligence-based forecasting claim accurately predict likelihood rain hours existing systems Today weather forecasts largely driven powerful numerical weather prediction NWP systems use equations describe movement fluids atmosphere predict likelihood rain types weather These models really amazing hours weeks terms weather prediction area especially zero hours models perform particularly poorly said Suman Ravuri staff research scientist DeepMind London co-lead project Precipitation nowcasting attempt blind spot Dr Peter Dueben coordinator machine learning AI activities European Centre Medium-Range Weather Forecasts involved research said In nowcasting try observations try make predictions weather going look couple minutes couple hours Machine learning help build tool extremely fast. DeepMind group attempting develop tools currently leading field added Its technology draws high-resolution radar data track moisture air repeatedly firing beam lower atmosphere measuring relative speed signal slowed water vapour Drawing conversations Met Office meteorologists types weather prediction tools useful Ravuri colleagues used machine learning approach called generative modelling develop tool make probabilistic predictions medium heavy rainfall minutes based past minutes high-resolution radar data As affecting individuals heavy rain disrupt transport energy supply networks agriculture DeepMind tool evaluated alongside existing rain prediction tools Met Office meteorologists ranked accuracy usefulness cases The results published Nature The DeepMind senior staff scientist Shakir Mohamed said AI potential aid answering complex scientific questions environmental science climate change This trial shows AI powerful tool right enabling forecasters spend time trawling growing piles prediction data instead better understand implications forecasts. Niall Robinson head partnerships product innovation Met Office said Extreme weather catastrophic consequences including loss life effects climate change suggest types events set become common As better short-term weather forecasts help people stay safe thrive This research demonstrates potential AI offer powerful tool improving short-term forecasts understanding weather patterns evolving. Dueben added encouraging big tech company Google working expert meteorologists develop new forecasting tools You build perfect tool going used forecasters pointless I think combination collaboration Google Met Office involvement forecasters new generative modelling approach provides new way represent distinct weather situations certainty predictions makes significant step forward
