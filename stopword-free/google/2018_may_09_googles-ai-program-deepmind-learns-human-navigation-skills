Notch win robots latest program Google artificial intelligence group DeepMind trounced experts maze game learned way like human Scientists noticed trained AI landscape spontaneously developed electrical activity akin seen specialised brain cells underpin human navigational skills So-called grid cells identified animals work earned researchers Nobel prize The latest breakthrough reveals potential human brain-like activity emerge scratch AI systems Beyond making smarter programs paves way computer engineers build models help neuroscientists better understand human brain After discovering AI-made grid cells DeepMind researchers beefed-up version program It went beat experienced players game involved racing rooms prize dropped virtual environment random location Equipped artificial grid cells AI faster shortcuts occasionally crop doors environment suddenly opened It doing kinds things animals direct routes possible shortcuts available said Dharshan Kumaran senior researcher DeepMind With grid cells performance markedly enhanced point surpasses expert human player. The feat marks milestone field artificial intelligence Until technology used proved superhuman object recognition games chess Go poker different cognitive challenge efficient navigation But research opens fresh possibilities Because AI program developed brain-like activity scratch scientists believe similar approach shed light mysterious processes human brain limbs controlled And need animal human experimentation There reason couldn use understand different functions brain performs It testbed experiments wouldn said Caswell Barry neuroscientist University College London worked project Writing journal Nature scientists describe built deep neural network computer program uses multiple layers artificial neurons process information They taught program basics navigation feeding kinds signals encode speed direction brains foraging rats With feedback performance AI got better better predicting moved virtual environment The scientists hoped training AI program develop grid cell-like activity precisely A quarter artificial neurons layer deep neural network begun firing like biological grid cells In words AI hit strategy map world human brain long ago We surprised worked said Caswell The degree similarity absolutely striking. Grid cells fundamental navigation humans mammals They behave invisible mesh hexagons laid land firing rapidly animal crosses hexagon In reality hexagons big small overlap Neuroscientists suspect imaginary mesh helps mammals work calculate shortest path goal An animation shows grid cells hexagonal pattern Photograph DeepMind In stage project scientists went build sophisticated AI incorporated artificial grid cell network They let loose virtual reality maze game Tests game showed AI used grid cells track position work direction distance goal direct route We tend think navigation everyday don understand said Kumaran What study shed light neural mechanisms underlie human navigation. Francesco Savelli expert artificial intelligence neuroscience Johns Hopkins University Maryland said magic AI systems like used come ways processing data solve task hand The emergence grid cells model impressive demonstration exactly said
