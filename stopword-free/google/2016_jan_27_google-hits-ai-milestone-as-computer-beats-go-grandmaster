When Gary Kasparov lost chess computer Deep Blue IBM marked milestone history artificial intelligence On Wednesday research paper released Nature Google earned position history books announcement subsidiary DeepMind built capable beating best human players world east Asian board game Go Go game involves placing black white tiles 19x19 board trying remove opponents far difficult computer master game chess DeepMind software AlphaGo successfully beat three-time European Go champion Fan Hui 5–0 series games company headquarters King Cross October Dr Tanguy Chouard senior editor Nature attended matches review process described victory really chilling watch It exciting moments career added But usual mixed feelings quiet room downstairs couldn help root poor human beaten. It victory computer program came decade expected As recently Rémi Coulom developer previous leading Go game AI Crazy Stone predicted years machine win top-rated human player handicap AlphaGo beat expectations approaching challenge completely different way previous software Building techniques DeepMind employed feats artificial intelligence learn play retro video games AlphaGo used company calls Deep Learning build understanding game It pick moves thought likely win When teaching computer play game simplest method tell rank possible course game best worst instruct pick best That sort strategy works trivial games draughts noughts crosses solved computers fully examined board state worked way play draw matter player However complex games Chess simple approach fails Chess just big turn approximately legal moves game lasts turns Enumerating board position becomes computationally impossible quickly took years IBM team work way beat Kasparov Go bigger The definition easy learn hard master essentially just rules governing core play involves players alternately placing black white tiles 19x19 board The stones placed empty space group stones colour empty space lose liberty removed board While game chess legal moves turn game Go 250 including 361 legal starting positions Chess games turns Go games 150 If Google tried solve game way noughts crosses solved examine rank obscene possible positions ballpark 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 That renders exhaustive search impossible selective search style used Deep Blue defeat Kasparov tricky run efficiently Adding woes trying master Go fact unlike chess difficult look board mathematically determine winning In chess player queen probably beat player queen taken possible assign values pieces come running score roughly ranks player prospects In Go contrast counters rarely removed board simple mathematical way determine stronger position game far progressed So AlphaGo focused different strategy As David Silver DeepMind co-lead researcher project puts AlphaGo looks ahead playing rest game imagination times over. The program involves neural networks software mimics structure human brain aggregate simple decisions complex choices running parallel One policy network trained observing millions boards Go uploaded online archive Using observations built predictive model expected piece played given knowledge board previous positions accurately guess expert player time compared previous record 44.4 groups This supervised learning backed bout reinforcement learning network set play learning victories losses carried 1m individual games course day The policy network capable predicting probability given played needed second filter help select moves best That network value network predicts winner game given particular board state Building AlphaGo isn just important feather DeepMind cap The company argues perfecting deep learning techniques crucial future work Demis Hassabis DeepMind founder says ultimately want apply techniques important real-world problems medical diagnostics climate modelling For DeepMind team focused final goal Go board match Lee Se-dol world champion Lee says regardless result meaningful event baduk Korean Go history I heard Google DeepMind AI surprisingly strong getting stronger I confident I win time
