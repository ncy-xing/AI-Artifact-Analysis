The battle future computing battle bring artificial intelligence mainstream Google quietly overhauling machine learning tool used improve popular services including Google Translate Google Photos TensorFlow used help teach computers process data ways similar human brain handles information It open source meaning Google published shared code online external developers use improve The latest version released Google Wednesday adds feature TensorFlow users asked tool public debut late ability operate multiple devices Instead limited processing capabilities single computer use distributed networks handle complicated tasks TensorFlow able use brain cells instead confined just TensorFlow developed improve services Google users interact regular basis It taught translation app understand language idiosyncrasies allowed photos tool identify subjects images uploaded servers easier Google mobile apps understand people saying giving verbal instructions search engine Humans excel tasks Most people tell cat dog think beyond literal translations follow conversation walk crowded street The human brain simply knows things But computers struggle tools TensorFlow used help devices perceive process world emulating neural networks inside heads Google previously used tool called DistBelief perform tasks TensorFlow developed improve DistBelief performance according Google chief executive Sundar Pichai times faster predecessor Many improvements Google services year partly attributed switch DistBelief TensorFlow period Matthew Zeiler intern DistBelief project founded visual AI service Clarifai based New York We building platform allows computers essentially allows developers include applications websites. Clarifai used Vimeo improve video search BuzzFeed manage continually growing media collection travel site Trivago automatically label photos contain ocean view show bedroom living room Neural nets getting used days. It important able train quickly split workers working different chunks data communicate synchronize data nodes allows learn efficiently. Deep learning huge opportunity right enables developers create applications way possible Neural networks new way programming computers It new way handling data. TensorFlow available public November It quick hit developers became popular project GitHub platform software engineers learn collaborate available months year Those improvements eventually reach ordinary people Google everyday products isn immediately obvious service suddenly became smarter accurate
