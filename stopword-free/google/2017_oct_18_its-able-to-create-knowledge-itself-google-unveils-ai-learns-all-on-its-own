Google artificial intelligence group DeepMind unveiled latest incarnation Go-playing program AlphaGo AI powerful derived thousands years human knowledge game inventing better moves space days Named AlphaGo Zero AI program hailed major advance mastered ancient Chinese board game scratch human help beyond told rules In games version famously beat Lee Sedol South Korean grandmaster following year AlphaGo Zero won The feat marks milestone road general-purpose AIs thrash humans board games Because AlphaGo Zero learns blank slate talents turned host real-world problems At DeepMind based London AlphaGo Zero working proteins fold massive scientific challenge drug discovery sorely needed shot arm Match AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol March Photograph Erikbenson For AlphaGo wasn just winning game Go said Demis Hassabis CEO DeepMind researcher team It big step building general-purpose algorithms. Most AIs described narrow perform single task translating languages recognising faces general-purpose AIs potentially outperform humans different tasks In decade Hassabis believes AlphaGo descendants work alongside humans scientific medical experts It opens new book computers teach humans play Go better used Tom Mitchell computer scientist Carnegie Mellon University Previous versions AlphaGo learned moves training thousands games played strong human amateurs professionals AlphaGo Zero help Instead learned purely playing millions times It began placing stones Go board random swiftly improved discovered winning strategies David Silver describes Go playing AI program AlphaGo Zero discovers new knowledge scratch Credit DeepMind It powerful previous approaches using human data human expertise fashion ve removed constraints human knowledge able create knowledge said David Silver AlphaGo lead researcher It work problems simulated computer making tasks driving question The program amasses skill procedure called reinforcement learning It method balance hand scuffed knees help humans master art bike riding When AlphaGo Zero plays good likely rewarded win When makes bad edges closer loss Demis Hassabis CEO DeepMind For AlphaGo wasn just winning game Go.

Eleni Vasilaki professor computational neuroscience Sheffield University said impressive feat This imply involving human expert training AlphaGo discovers better moves surpass human intelligence specific game said But pointed computers beating humans games involve complex calculations precision far matching humans tasks AI fails tasks surprisingly easy humans said Just look performance humanoid robot everyday tasks walking running kicking ball. Tom Mitchell computer scientist Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh called AlphaGo Zero outstanding engineering accomplishment He added It closes book humans going catch computers Go I guess answer But opens new book computers teach humans play Go better used to. David Silver describes AI program AlphaGo Zero learns play Go Credit DeepMind Related The superhero artificial intelligence genius check The idea welcomed Andy Okun president American Go Association I don know morale suffer computers strong actually kind fun explore game neural-network software winning out-reading seeing patterns shapes deeply. While AlphaGo Zero step general-purpose AI work problems perfectly simulated computer making tasks driving car question AIs match humans huge range tasks long way Hassabis said More realistic decade use AI help humans discover new drugs materials crack mysteries particle physics I hope kinds algorithms future versions AlphaGo-inspired things routinely working scientific experts medical experts advancing frontier science medicine Hassabis said
